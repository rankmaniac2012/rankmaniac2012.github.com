Rarely does a day go by when I don't get asked a few questions on the subject. So I've decided to post this FAQ article in the hopes that it will help people understand the basics and make them a little more comfortable with the whole domain. Q Why are search engines important to me A 85 of all website traffic is driven by search engines.

It does this to discourage the rankmaniac 2012 creation of SPAM websites sites rankmaniac 2012 which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting the rankmaniac 2012 theory but there is also a lot discounting it. No one has categorically proven its existence.

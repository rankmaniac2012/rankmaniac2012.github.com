SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a <a href='../../../../index/increase/whos/representative/namerobots.html'> good </a> search engine ranking is decide which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword rankmaniac 2012 <a href='../../../../index/increase/whos/representative/doubleday.html'> analysis. </a> Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the benefits you offer your customers. There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two examples are Overtures inventory tool which you can find at httpinventory.overture.comdsearchinventorysuggestion. This tool is free and very rankmaniac 2012 easy to <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-garden.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' /> use and understand but it only tells you how many searches have been conducted in the previous month for your keyword and similar keywords. WordTracker which you can find at httpwww.wordtracker.com. WordTracker is a much more powerful tool but you have to pay to use it you can subscribe for a day for around 10. WordTracker helps you find the most appropriate keyword for your site rankmaniac 2012 by telling you what people are really searching for. Heres how it works You type in a word which summarizes what you do and it tells you how many times that word has been searched for in the last month. It also tells you rankmaniac 2012 how many other websites rankmaniac 2012 are using that word as a keyword i.e. targeting the same customers you are. Based on this information rankmaniac 2012 it rates the word. The best keywords are the ones that a lot of people are searching for but which few websites are targeting. WordTracker even suggests and rates alternative related words. TIP When youre using WordTracker bear in mind that its just talking about numbers and numbers dont always tell the whole story. So dont just jump in and use the best rated keywords you need to consider your own situation. rankmaniac 2012 It may be the case that youre forced to select a keyword phrase which is not rated particularly highly. There are two situations in which this might happen i. Youre in a niche market with rankmaniac 2012 relatively few customers searching for the keyword. In this situation youll probably find it relatively easy to reach the top of the rankings but you wont generate a rankmaniac 2012 huge volume of traffic when you get there. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 15 Step 3 Choose your keywords 15 ii. A lot of your competitors are targeting your keyword its hotly contested but its the only one you can use. If you target it youll just have to work a bit harder on your backlinks in order to rank highly. When theres a lot of competition for a keyword its likely that the traffic payoff is good once you reach top. Single Keyword v Keyword Phrases Generally speaking youre better off targeting phrases not single words. For most businesses theres simply too much competition for single keywords. For instance if youre in computer sales rankmaniac 2012 your normally wouldnt choose computers as your keyword. Go to Google and search for computers rankmaniac 2012 and youll see why There are nearly 200 million results and the top rankings are dominated by the multinationals at the time of writing Apple and Dell. Whats more research rankmaniac 2012 shows that customers are becoming more searchsavvy theyre searching for more and more specific strings. Theyre learning that by being more specific they find what theyre looking for much faster. So instead of targeting computers try to think of a more specific keyword phrase. Ask yourself whats unique about your business Perhaps you sell cheap second hand computers Then why not use cheap second hand computers as your keyword phrase This way youll not only stand a chance in the rankings youll also display in much more targeted searches. In other words a higher percentage of your sites visitors will be people looking to buy cheap second hand computers as opposed to people after brand new computers people researching the history of the computer and people trying to figure out how they can use a computer to bath their dog. Develop a keyword strategy Also think about developing rankmaniac 2012 a keyword rankmaniac 2012 strategy. If you start out targeting a very specific keyword phrase as described above rankmaniac 2012 make sure it includes the more generic hotly contested single keyword. For example youll notice that the keyword phrase above cheap second hand computers includes the single keyword computers. This way youre really targeting both at once. As your sites importance or PageRank and search engine presence increases youll start to rank for the single word as well. In rankmaniac 2012 time youll start ranking well for computers even though youre only actively targeting cheap second hand computers. TIP Google PageRank PR is how Google scores a websites importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. Chapter Summary Find out what words <a href='../../../../index/increase/whos/representative.html'> your </a> customers are searching for and make them your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 16 Step 3 Choose your keywords 16 Use keyword phrases instead of single keywords but develop rankmaniac 2012 a long term keyword strategy which will increase your ranking for hotly contested single keywords <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> even as rankmaniac 2012 you target your specific keyword phrase.

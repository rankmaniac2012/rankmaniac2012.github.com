If you move one of your pages from one directory to another its address will change. E.g. If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs its address will change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm. This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no longer work. It is vital that you do not let this happen.

There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a rankmaniac 2012 week but <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/write/shop.html'> don't </a> specify which keywords you will rank highly for. Instead of ranking highly for <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/investment.html'> the </a> words that your customers are searching for you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure meaningless keyword phrases like red brochure book printing in Jamaica. Also always be clear <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/write/opportunities.html'> in </a> rankmaniac 2012 your own mind on exactly what you're paying for.

Most link partner requests are sent rankmaniac 2012 by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond.html'> Copywriting </a> Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their rankmaniac 2012 website most webmasters of high PR rankmaniac 2012 sites will not be interested because rankmaniac 2012 its extra rankmaniac 2012 work. Whats more they wont want <a href='../../../index/think/second/subject/fine.html'> to </a> obscure the purpose of their site rankmaniac 2012 with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. rankmaniac 2012 TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all <br /><br /> sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally rankmaniac 2012 considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any rankmaniac 2012 site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall.html'> have </a> to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then rankmaniac 2012 youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast.

You may even be penalized more rankmaniac 2012 harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in <a href='../../../index/think/second/subject/spending.html'> the </a> ranking of your site.

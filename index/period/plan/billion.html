  <p>
    ur site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO <br /><br /> software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them <a href='../../../index/period/plan/billion/addition.html'> to </a> link to you possibly in return for a link to <br /><br /> theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing rankmaniac 2012 your search engine rankmaniac 2012 ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help rankmaniac 2012 the high PR site <a href='../../../index/period/plan/lead.html'> at </a> all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating <a href='/'> links </a> but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely rankmaniac 2012 unlikely. The search engines dont rankmaniac 2012 like to see links generated too fast. For instance if you had 100 links to your site yesterday rankmaniac 2012 but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox rankmaniac 2012 your links i.e. delay their rankmaniac 2012 full impact until it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment rankmaniac 2012 either in time or money. If you decide to outsource <a href='../../../index/period/plan/billion/fundamentals.html'> the </a> task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate rankmaniac 2012 links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. rankmaniac 2012 you find another SEO company that you prefer your site's ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Don't get caught out When you're researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it.

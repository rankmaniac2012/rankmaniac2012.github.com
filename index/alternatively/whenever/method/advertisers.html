Google doesn't pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning.

Write a good article <a href='../../../../index/alternatively/whenever/method/print.html'> and </a> it always reflects well on you no matter rankmaniac 2012 where it's published.

A little about search engines rankmaniac 2012 Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines rankmaniac 2012 its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue. And <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond/sponsored.html'> remember </a> being ranked number 1 when you search for your <br /><br /> company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue. In other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The rankmaniac 2012 real search results. The rankmaniac 2012 results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their money. Advertisers <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond/sale.html'> pay </a> the search engines to display their ad whenever someone searches for a rankmaniac 2012 word which is related to their product or service. These ads <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond/drop.html'> look </a> similar to the <a href='/'> natural </a> search results but are normally labeled Sponsored Links and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more <br /><br /> attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads. When we talk about search engine ranking were talking about ranking rankmaniac 2012 well in the natural rankmaniac 2012 search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT rankmaniac 2012 You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for <a href='../../../index/think/second/today.html'> their </a> search results by sending out rankmaniac 2012 spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is <a href='../../../index/think/second/backlinks.html'> where </a> SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the rankmaniac 2012 art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are Keywords for relevance rankmaniac 2012 Links to your site for importance TIP Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to rankmaniac 2012 analyze your rankmaniac 2012 website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure rankmaniac 2012 out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO rankmaniac 2012 Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches for those words. For more rankmaniac 2012 information on choosing keywords see Step 3 Choose rankmaniac 2012 your rankmaniac 2012 keywords on p.14. on using keywords on your site see Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines on p.17. Links to your site Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is. They assume that if its important enough for a lot of other sites to link to its important enough for them to display at the top of the rankings. Links to your site backlinks or inbound links are the single most important factor in ranking. The rankmaniac 2012 more links you have to your site from other sites the better your ranking. rankmaniac 2012 For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27. Chapter Summary If you have a lot of the right keywords used in real sentences distributed realistically throughout your site and a lot of links from other relevant sites you stand a good chance of being ranked highly. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty rankmaniac 2012 Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your rankmaniac 2012 content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond/reprinted.html'> search </a> engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right it takes months before your site is even indexed and more months <br /><br /> before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google will probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month rankmaniac 2012 or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html <a href='../../../index/think/second/subject.html'> enter </a> your URL domain name and a few comments rankmaniac 2012 or keywords to describe your site. rankmaniac 2012 Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it. You only have to do it once and <a href='../../../index/think/second.html'> only </a> for your top level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 12 Step 2 Submit rankmaniac 2012 your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond/recent.html'> partly </a> because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 <a href='../../../index/think/second/determined.html'> weeks </a> <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall.html'> before </a> your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 rankmaniac 2012 search engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rest. Whats more at the time of rankmaniac 2012 writing most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. rankmaniac 2012 The only ones that do are Google described <br /><br /> above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html offers free submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submission Netscape covered by Google submission Fast All the Web covered by Yahoo submission Ask Jeeves Teoma at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Hotbot at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Lycos at rankmaniac 2012 d

Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 rankmaniac 2012 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search rankmaniac 2012 engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches for those words.

Links to your <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> site Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is. rankmaniac 2012 They assume that if its important enough for a lot of other sites to link to its important enough for them to display at the top of the rankings. Links to your site backlinks or inbound links are the single rankmaniac 2012 most important factor in ranking. The more links you have to your site from other sites the better your ranking.

Chapter Summary If you have a lot rankmaniac 2012 of the right keywords used in real sentences distributed realistically throughout your site and a lot of links from other relevant sites you stand a good chance of being ranked highly. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always rankmaniac 2012 taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right it takes months before your site is even indexed and more months rankmaniac 2012 before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does rankmaniac 2012 this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google will probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching rankmaniac 2012 potential customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html enter your URL domain rankmaniac 2012 name and rankmaniac 2012 a few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it. You only have to do it once and only for your top level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 12 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the rankmaniac 2012 next time theyre out and rankmaniac 2012 about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it rankmaniac 2012 takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 search engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rest. Whats more at the rankmaniac 2012 time of writing most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The only ones that do are Google described above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html offers free submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submission Netscape covered by Google submission Fast All the Web covered by Yahoo submission Ask Jeeves Teoma at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Hotbot at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Lycos at date of writing was not accepting new submissions AOL at rankmaniac 2012 date of writing was rankmaniac 2012 not accepting new submissions Looksmart at date of writing was not accepting new submissions TIP My website httpwww.divinewrite.com reached no.1 worldwide on Google.com for my primary keyword copywriter without a dollar being spent on search engine submission. I only ever submitted my site to the engines that offer free submission. Do I need to submit my site to other search engines As a rankmaniac 2012 rule no. With an estimated 8.8 billion pages indexed approximately 76 of the Internet Google is number 1 when it comes to search engines. Its argued that once Google has indexed your SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 13 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 13 site the other search engines will follow. rankmaniac 2012 Theoretically you dont actually need to submit your site to Google either because its always on the lookout for new content and will eventually find your site of its own accord. Google actually states Given the large number of sites submitting URLs its likely your pages will be found in an automatic crawl before they make it into our index through the URL submission form. Google Information for Webmasters httpwww.google.com.auwebmasters1.htmlA1 Personally I wouldnt like to take the risk. Having said that it certainly doesnt hurt to submit your site to other search engines especially if you havent developed any content for it yet. Chapter Summary Submit your domain name to Google as soon as you register it even if you havent rankmaniac 2012 built your site yet or done anything else. Although you dont actually need to submit your site to the other search engines you may as well submit it to Yahoo and MSN as they offer free and simple submissions. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is decide which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword rankmaniac 2012 analysis. Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the benefits you offer your customers. There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two examples are Overtures inventory tool which you can find rankmaniac 2012 at httpinventory.overture.comdsearchinventorysuggestion. This tool is free and very easy to rankmaniac 2012 use and rankmaniac 2012 understand but it only tells you how many searches have been conducted in the previous month for your keyword and similar keywords.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 8 Step 1 rankmaniac 2012 Understand what SEO means 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means rankmaniac 2012 Before launching straight into an explanation of SEO lets talk a bit about search engines. A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of its rightful rankmaniac 2012 traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic rankmaniac 2012 and thus more advertising revenue. In other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list rankmaniac 2012 of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/categorically/optimizing.html'> money. </a> Advertisers pay the search engines to display their ad whenever someone searches for a word which is related to their product or service. These ads look similar to the natural search results but are normally labeled Sponsored Links and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads. When we talk about search engine ranking were talking about ranking well in the natural search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-garden.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' /> engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are Keywords for relevance Links to your site for importance TIP Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/giving.html'> when </a> you start your SEO journey. Figure out <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/exchange.html'> what </a> words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words rankmaniac 2012 are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> in searches for those words. For more information on choosing keywords see Step 3 Choose your keywords on p.14. on using keywords on your site <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/categorically/next.html'> see </a> Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines on p.17. Links to your site Links to your <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/categorically/readable.html'> site </a> tell the search engines how important your site is. They assume that if its important enough for a lot of other sites to link to its important enough for them to display at the top of the rankings. Links to your site backlinks or inbound links are the single most important factor in ranking. The more links you have to your site from other sites the better your ranking. For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27. Chapter Summary If you have a lot of the right keywords used in real sentences distributed realistically throughout your rankmaniac 2012 site and a lot of links from other relevant sites you stand a good chance of being ranked highly. rankmaniac 2012 SEO Secrets V1.3 rankmaniac 2012 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name <a href='../../../index/increase/generating/categorically/few.html'> submit </a> <a href='../../../index/increase/generating.html'> it </a> to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to rankmaniac 2012 Google. Dont wait There rankmaniac 2012 are two reasons for this.

As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites rankmaniac 2012 which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site. By submitting your domain name rankmaniac 2012 to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content.

Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. rankmaniac 2012 How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 search engines account rankmaniac 2012 for about 90 of web traffic.

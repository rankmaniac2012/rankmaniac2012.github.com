SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 17 Step 4 rankmaniac 2012 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 17 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines Once youve figured out what words your customers are using at the search engines you need to use those words frequently on rankmaniac 2012 your site and in the right places both within your copy and within your HTML code HTML meta tags. This is a big part of what is known as optimizing your website for search engines. There are also some site structure or information architecture and web design considerations discussed below. TIP When you optimize your website for a particular word youre essentially telling the search engines to include you in the results when people search for that word. How high up the rankings you appear depends largely on the <a href='../../../../index/receiving/reason/story/colorcheap.html'> number </a> of links back to your site there rankmaniac 2012 are. For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27. Optimizing your web copy The trick to optimizing your copy is using the most important keywords frequently and in rankmaniac 2012 the right places without compromising the readability of your copy. But how do you define frequently And what are the right places What if you want to target a few different keywords And for that matter what should the wordcount of my pages be Below are a <br /><br /> few tips which will help <a href='../../../../index/receiving/reason/story/monthly.html'> you </a> out. What should the wordcount of my pages be Youll hear a lot about the importance of a lot of content. While I definitely agree that content is king there is no need to write volumes. You can reach rankmaniac 2012 the top of the rankmaniac 2012 search engines with a page wordcount of between 1001000. Below 100 is probably too little for the search engines. Above 1000 is definitely too much for your visitors. Certainly rankmaniac 2012 dont be intimidated into writing pages and pages of copy for your home page or any other page rankmaniac 2012 where short succinct copy is required. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 18 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for rankmaniac 2012 Search Engines 18 How many times should I use a keyword You dont want to fill every page up with every keyword youre targeting. This simply dilutes your sites relevance and reduces readability. Search engines and visitors alike will object the search engines will see your site as spam and visitors to your site will find it hard to read if not meaningless. A good rule of thumb rankmaniac 2012 is to aim for a sitewide average keyword density of around 2 measured using LiveKeywordAnalysis httpwww.livekeywordanalysis.com. Density is a measure of frequency in rankmaniac 2012 relation to the total wordcount of the page. So if your page has 200 words and your keyword phrase appears 10 times its density is 5. When you actually try to do this youll see that 2 isnt easy to achieve. The easiest way to do it is to be specific. As you write every sentence ask yourself Could I be more specific rankmaniac 2012 For rankmaniac 2012 example dont just say our computers or our products ask yourself if you can get away with saying our cheap second hand computers. Similarly dont say things like with our help instead say with rankmaniac 2012 the help of our cheap second hand computers. Once you rankmaniac 2012 get the hang of it youll find there are more than enough opportunities to replace <br /><br /> a generic term with your keyword phrase. Obviously theres a bit of an art to it. Sometimes it ends up just sounding rankmaniac 2012 like youre repeating your keyword phrase over and over again. If this happens you may just need to restructure the sentence or paragraph. Remember your site reflects the quality of rankmaniac 2012 your product or service. If your site is hard to read people will infer a lot about your offering Readability is allimportant to visitors. And after all its the visitors who buy your product or service not the search engines. NOTE You dont need to <a href='../../../../index/receiving/reason/story/research.html'> be </a> paranoid about density. You can have some pages which have a high density and some which have a low density. What if I rankmaniac 2012 want to target more than one keyword Its best to only target one keyword per page. If you try to target more your keywords will be competing against each other diluting each others impact. If you need to target more than one keyword simply create a page for each. For example divide your Second Hand Computers site into separate pages for Macs and PCs and then segment again into Notebooks Desktops etc. This way youll be able to incorporate very specific keyword phrases into your copy e.g. For your Macs page focus on cheap second hand macs. For the PCs page rankmaniac 2012 focus on cheap second hand pcs etc. See Link paths on p.22 for information on using text links between these pages. Where should I use my keywords When assessing what your website is about search engines rankmaniac 2012 pay close attention to the words you use in your text links and headings. So make sure your links and headings are keyword rich. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write <br /><br /> Copywriting Pty Ltd 19 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 19 Using keywords in links When you link from one page to another try to use your target keyword as the link text the part thats normally blue and underlined. For example on your Cheap Second Hand Macs page you could include a text link to Cheap Second Hand PCs. IMPORTANT Search engines and humans like different things when it comes to links. Search engines like to see your keywords used toward the top of the page. So if youre using keywords in your links it makes sense that you rankmaniac 2012 put the links at the top of the page. Unfortunately humans tend to find this distracting. And because they start clicking on links before theyve finished reading the whole page they become easily lost and dont grasp the intended message. In most cases visitors prefer a text link at the bottom of the page. But there is a solution if you have links within the main body of rankmaniac 2012 your copy simply make them unmarked i.e. remove the blue font colour and the underlining. To do this include the following in your CSS file style typetextcss a textdecoration none style Then format the HTML of rankmaniac 2012 each link as follows As well as providing cheap second hand Macs we sell rankmaniac 2012 high quality a hrefpcs.htm styletextdecorationnonefont color000000cheap second hand pcsfonta. Using keywords in headings Just as customers rely on headings to scan your site so to do search engines. This means headings play a big part in how the search engines will index your site. Try to include your keyword phrase in your headings. In fact think about inserting extra headings just rankmaniac 2012 for this purpose. Generally this will also help the readability of the site because it will help customers scan read. For example if you have a page detailing the benefits of cheap second hand computers you could break it up into logical sections with the following headings. The cost benefits of cheap our second hand computers The technical benefits of our cheap second hand computers SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 20 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 20 The support benefits of our cheap second hand computers Using keywords at the start of the page Many SEO experts believe that the search engines see words at the start of a page as more representative of what your site is about than words at the end i.e. prominence. So its a good idea to make sure you use your keywords toward the start of each page. Optimizing your HTML code Within the HTML code behind your page there are things call meta tags. These are short notes within the header of the code which describe some aspects of your page to the search engines. Although there is some debate over rankmaniac 2012 how important meta tags are when it rankmaniac 2012 comes to SEO its generally agreed that they shouldnt be ignored. Whether youre building your website yourself or youre getting a web designer to do it its a good idea to understand the basics. There are four main meta tags you need to consider Tag name How it should look in the code Explanation Title titleCheap second hand The title is the most important of the computers Widget meta tags. Try to use your keyword at least once in the title. Computerstitle Also its not just important for your ranking it also has the biggest impact on your Click Thru Rate CTR. The text you put in the title will appear as the link text in your Google listing the bit that people will read first and click on.

So try to keep your Title text to a max of 66 characters. SEO Secret

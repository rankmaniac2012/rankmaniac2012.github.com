Rarely does a day go by when I don't get asked a few questions on the subject.

Q Why are search engines important to me A 85 of all website traffic is driven by search engines. The only online activity more popular than search is email. 79.2 of US users don't go <br /><br /> to page 2 of search results. 42 of users click on the no.1 result. For the under40 agegroup the Internet will become the most used media in the next 23 years. Q How do search engines decide on their rankings A IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify rankmaniac 2012 relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results.

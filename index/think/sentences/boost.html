    engine spiders text links are like doorways from page to page and site to site. This means websites are generally better indexed by search engines if their spiders rankmaniac 2012 can traverse the entire site using text links. If your site is simple you can simply link each page to every other page using text links at the bottom of the page. But if your site is complex this is impractical. Instead youll need to create a hierarchical structure and link top to bottom and left to right using text links assuming this doesnt detract from the usability of your site. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 23 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 23 Figure 1 Text Link Path <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/boost/serve.html'> Hierarchy </a> NOTE In addition to being kind to search engine spiders this approach allows you to target one keyword phrase per page. Site map You should also use a site map to link all of your pages together. A site map is a single page which contains a list of text links to every page in the site and every page contains a text link back to the site map. Think of your site map as being rankmaniac 2012 at the center of a spiderweb. TIP Site maps are used by both search engine spiders and human rankmaniac 2012 visitors so remember to make it userfriendly. Try using bolding and indenting to represent your site hierarchy. See httpwww.divinewrite.comsite.htm for an example. Optimizing your web construction Search engine spiders and robots dont see websites the way you and I do. They require your site to be designed a particular way. If you dont observe a few rules of thumb you can severely rankmaniac 2012 hamper your search engine presence. Following is a list of the main things you need to be aware of. There are quite a few more but these are the most important ones. This list will be most useful if your web designer hasnt had SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 24 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 24 a lot of experience with SEO. If you engage an experienced SEO web <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/investment.html'> designer </a> theyll already know all the issues far more than are listed here. Dos Design rankmaniac 2012 your site in HTML i.e. HTML based copy and headings and text based links at the base of each page as per existing site Use static URLs Use standard rankmaniac 2012 rollovers andor CSS formatting for navigation <a href='../../../index/think/sentences.html'> menu </a> Create a robots.txt file. This file is used to inform the search engine spider which pages on a <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/write.html'> site </a> should not be indexed check out httpwww.123promotion.co.uktoolsrobotstxtgenerator.php for an automated one. Alternatively you can do a similar thing by placing tags in the header section of your HTML for search engine robotsspiders to read. These tags are as follows o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTALL tells the spiders to crawl and index your entire site o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNONE tells the spiders not to index anything. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNOINDEXFOLLOW says dont index this particular page but follow its links to other pages e.g. for use on secure or private pages. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTINDEXNOFOLLOW says to index the page but not follow its links. Create a 404 error handling page and place a sitemap on the 404 page. Use absolute links not relative links. Donts Dont embed your copy within a graphic Dont use frames Dont rankmaniac 2012 use internal JavaScript or Flash Dont use id as a parameter if you want maximal Googlebot crawlage many sites use id <br /><br /> with session IDs rankmaniac 2012 that Googlebot usually avoids urls with that parameter SEO Secrets V1.3 rankmaniac 2012 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 25 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 25 Redesigning an existing site If youre redesigning an existing site make sure you pay close attention to your file structure. If you move one of your pages from one directory <a href='/'> to </a> another its address will change. E.g. If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/last.html'> its </a> address will change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm. This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no <br /><br /> longer work. It is vital that you do not let this happen. Remember backlinks are the key to a high ranking. rankmaniac 2012 There are two solutions to this problem i Dont change your directory structure or ii If you DO change your directory structure make sure you do 301 redirects rankmaniac 2012 from the old pages to the new ones. Your web designer will know what youre talking about when you instruct them to use 301 rankmaniac 2012 redirects. Also if your site already has a decent ranking or youve worked hard on your meta tags and youre happy with them make sure your web designer doesnt change your meta tags. Paying an SEO company to optimize your site If you decide to pay an SEO company to optimize your site for you always ask them exactly what they will be doing. Ask them what keywords they will be targeting and how will target them. There are no secret methods rankmaniac 2012 so if they can't or won't tell you DO NOT engage them. There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a week rankmaniac 2012 but don't specify which keywords you will rank highly for. rankmaniac 2012 Instead of ranking highly for the rankmaniac 2012 words that your customers are searching for you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure meaningless keyword phrases like red brochure book printing in Jamaica. Also always be clear in your own mind on rankmaniac 2012 exactly what you're paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Use your keyword frequently but not too frequently. Go for a sitewide average keyword density rankmaniac 2012 of around 2. Only target <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/boost/votes.html'> one </a> keyword per page unless there is very little competition for your keywords. If you need to target more than one keyword create a new page for each. Use keywords in links and headings. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 26 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 26 Try to use keywords more often at the start of the page than rankmaniac 2012 at the <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/boost/divine.html'> end. </a> Use your keywords in the Title Description Keywords and Alt meta tags. Structure your site around your keywords. Ensure spiders can traverse your entire site via text links. Create rankmaniac 2012 a text based site map which links to every page and which every page links to via text links. If your web designer is not an SEO expert make sure you provide them with some optimization rules. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 27 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 27 Step 5 Generate links back to <br /><br /> your site Links are the single most important aspect of SEO.

When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/boost/right.html'> <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/directly.html'> it </a> </a> rankmaniac 2012 says Hey this site must be credible and important because others in the same industry are pointing to it. How do I generate lots of ideal links There are many possible ways to generate links. Some are dubious like autogeneration software and sites set up by webmasters simply to host links to their other sites and I wont be discussing them here. rankmaniac 2012 Others like those <a href='../../../index/think/sentences/hierarchy.html'> discussed </a> below are legitimate.

Whats rankmaniac 2012 more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo rankmaniac 2012 is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue. In rankmaniac 2012 other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine.

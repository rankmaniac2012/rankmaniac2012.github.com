If you move one of your pages from one directory to another its address will change. E.g. If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs its address will change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm. This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no longer work. It is vital that you do not let this happen. Remember backlinks are the key to a rankmaniac 2012 high ranking. There are two solutions to this problem i Dont change your directory structure or ii If you DO change your directory structure make sure you do 301 redirects from the old pages to the new ones. Your web designer will know what youre talking about when you instruct them to use 301 redirects. Also if your site already has a decent ranking or youve worked hard on your meta tags and youre happy with them make sure your web designer doesnt change your meta tags. Paying an SEO company to optimize your site If you decide rankmaniac 2012 to pay an SEO rankmaniac 2012 company to optimize your site for you always ask them exactly what they will be doing. Ask them what keywords they will be targeting and how rankmaniac 2012 will target them. There are rankmaniac 2012 no secret methods so if they cant or wont tell you DO NOT engage them. There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a week but dont specify which keywords you will rank highly for. Instead of ranking highly for the words that your customers are searching for you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure meaningless keyword phrases like red brochure book printing in Jamaica. Also always be clear in your own rankmaniac 2012 mind on exactly what youre paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they rankmaniac 2012 plan to do it. Chapter Summary Use your keyword frequently but not too frequently. Go for a sitewide average keyword density of around 2. Only target one keyword per page unless there is very little competition for your keywords. If you need to target more than one keyword create rankmaniac 2012 a new page for each. Use keywords in links and headings. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 26 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 26 Try to use keywords more often at the start of the page than at the end. Use your keywords in the Title Description Keywords and Alt meta tags. Structure your site around your keywords. Ensure spiders can traverse your entire site via text links. Create a text based site map which links to every page and which <a href='/'> <a href='../../../../index/votes/countries/static.html'> </a> every </a> page links to via text links. If your web designer is not an SEO expert make <a href='../../../../index/votes/countries/static/exactly.html'> sure </a> you provide them with some optimization rules. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 27 rankmaniac 2012 Step 5 Generate links rankmaniac 2012 back to your site 27 Step 5 Generate rankmaniac 2012 links back to your site Links are the single most important aspect of SEO. Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Of course nothing is ever that simple. There are links and there are rankmaniac 2012 links. Before launching into a discussion about the best ways to generate links lets first discuss what kind of links you should be trying to generate. When deciding whether to display your site in rankmaniac 2012 its search results a search engine looks to see if youre part of a credible network of related sites. rankmaniac 2012 This means that the ideal kind of links are those that come from relevant sites sites which rankmaniac 2012 use the same keywords come from important sites have a high ranking include your keyword as part of the visible link text include varying link text not the same link text each time and come from <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> a page that links to few other sites. When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions it says Hey this site must be credible and important because others in the same industry are pointing to it. How do I generate lots of ideal links There are many possible ways to generate links. Some are dubious like autogeneration software and sites set up by webmasters simply to host links to their rankmaniac 2012 other sites and I wont be discussing them here. Others like rankmaniac 2012 those discussed below are legitimate. NOTE Link generation is an ongoing often tedious task. You need to be dedicated and systematic. In other words you need a strategy. Take a look through the link generation alternatives discussed below to see what suits you best. Then put your thinking cap on and get SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 28 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 28 creative. Its a new and very exciting field there are rankmaniac 2012 undoubtedly many undiscovered ways to generate links. This chapter is just a starting point. Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo Directories The first thing rankmaniac 2012 you should do is add a link in the following two directories DMOZ Open Directory Project httpwww.dmoz.comadd.html rankmaniac 2012 the largest most comprehensive humanedited directory of the Web. It is constructed rankmaniac 2012 and maintained by a vast global community of volunteer editors. DMOZ does not charge for submissions. NOTE This is the same as the Google Directory. Yahoo Directory httpsecom.yahoo.comdirsubmitintro Yahoo charges for submissions at the time of writing the submission fee was USD299. The search engines regularly crawl these directories in search of new links and they value these links quite highly largely because the directories are humanedited. Check where your competitors links are coming from Next check who is linking to your high ranking competitors. This method takes a long time but youll be surprised where some of their links come from. To <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> check on the links of your competitors STEP 1 Go to Google rankmaniac 2012 and search for your keyword. STEP 2 Make a note of the top 5 competitors who appear write down their domain name. STEP 3 Return to Google and search for the first domain name in the list i.e. type www.competitorsdomainname.com in the search field. STEP 4 Google will then display a screen which says Google can show you the following information for this URL At the bottom of the list of option is Find web pages that contain the term www.competitorsdomainname.com. Click on this option. STEP 5 Google will display all the pages it can find that link to your competitors website. TIP If there are many results bookmark the search results page as this process will take a long time possibly months. STEP 6 Visit each page TIP rankmaniac 2012 Right click <a href='../../../../index/votes/countries/static/lists.html'> on </a> the first result and select Open in New Window. By opening a separate window to see the page you wont lose your search results page. STEP 7 Try think of a way to get a link to your website on the same page TIP <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012.jpg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' /> Avoid sending them an email as webmaster receive a lot of SPAM and your email will likely go unnoticed. Try calling them instead. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 29 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 29 STEP 8 Repeat for each of your top 5 ranking competitors. TIP In the list of results the sites which appear high up in the list of results are likely to have a higher Google PageRank PR see Glossary than the sites which appear toward the end of the list. You should be more interested in obtaining links to sites with a high PR assuming theyre also relevant. Article PR Write and submit articles for Internet publication Next write articles and do some article PR Ive always found this to be the best way to generate inbound links. Write helpful articles and let publishers of newsletters and ezines use them for free on the proviso that they link back to your site. People who publish ezines and newsletters are always hungry for quality content. And there are many websites out there dedicated to giving them just that. If you submit a well written relevant helpful article to one of those sites you can have thousands of newsletter publishers ready to snap it up. Then you just sit back and watch the links multiply TIP The article PR method is beneficial in other ways too.

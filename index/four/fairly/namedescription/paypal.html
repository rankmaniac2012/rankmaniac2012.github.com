SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 18 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 18 How many times should I use a keyword You dont want to fill every page up with every keyword youre targeting. This simply dilutes your sites relevance and <a href='../../../../index/four/fairly/namedescription/becoming.html'> reduces </a> readability. rankmaniac 2012 Search rankmaniac 2012 engines and visitors alike will object the search engines will see your site as spam and visitors to your site will find it hard rankmaniac 2012 to read if not meaningless. A rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 good rule of thumb is to aim for a sitewide average keyword density of around 2 measured using LiveKeywordAnalysis httpwww.livekeywordanalysis.com. Density is a measure of <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> frequency in relation to rankmaniac 2012 the total wordcount of the page.

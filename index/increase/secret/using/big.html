Of course most dont bother to do this so its a good rankmaniac 2012 idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a web page. Google doesnt pick rankmaniac 2012 them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means rankmaniac 2012 they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication.

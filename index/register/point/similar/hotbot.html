Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Of course nothing is ever that simple. There are links and there are links. Before launching into a discussion about the best ways to generate links lets first discuss what kind of rankmaniac 2012 links you should be trying to generate. When deciding whether to display your site in its search results a search engine looks to see if youre part of a credible network of related sites. This means that the ideal kind of links are those that come from relevant sites sites which use the same keywords come from important sites have a high ranking include your keyword as part of the visible link text include rankmaniac 2012 varying link text not rankmaniac 2012 the same link text each time and come from a page that links to few other sites. When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions it says Hey this site must be credible and important because others in the same industry are pointing to it. How do I generate lots of ideal links There are many possible ways to generate links. Some are dubious like autogeneration software and sites set up by webmasters simply to host links to their other sites and I wont be discussing them here. Others like those discussed below are legitimate. NOTE Link rankmaniac 2012 generation is an ongoing often tedious task. You need to be dedicated and systematic. In other words you need a strategy.

Its a new and very exciting field there are undoubtedly many undiscovered ways to generate links. This chapter is just a starting point. Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo Directories The first thing you should do is add a link in the following two <br /><br /> directories DMOZ Open Directory Project httpwww.dmoz.comadd.html the largest most comprehensive humanedited directory of the Web. It is constructed and maintained by a vast global community of volunteer editors. DMOZ does not charge for submissions. NOTE This is the same as the Google Directory.

You should be more interested in obtaining links to sites with a high PR assuming theyre also relevant. Article PR Write and submit articles for Internet publication Next write articles and do some article PR Ive always found this to be the best way rankmaniac 2012 to generate inbound links. Write helpful articles and let publishers of newsletters and ezines use them for free on the proviso that they link back to your site. rankmaniac 2012 People who publish ezines and newsletters are always hungry for quality content. And there are many rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 websites out there dedicated to giving them just that. rankmaniac 2012 If you submit a well written relevant helpful article to one of those sites you can have thousands of newsletter publishers ready to snap it up.

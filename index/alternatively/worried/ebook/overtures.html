SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 17 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 17 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines Once youve figured out what words your customers are using at the search engines you need to use those words frequently on your site and in the right places rankmaniac 2012 both within your copy and rankmaniac 2012 within your HTML code HTML meta tags. This is a rankmaniac 2012 big part rankmaniac 2012 of what is known as optimizing your website for search engines. There are also some site structure or information architecture and web design considerations discussed below. TIP When you optimize your website for a particular word youre essentially telling the search engines to include you in the results when people search for that word. How high up the rankings you appear depends largely on the number of links back to your site there are. For more rankmaniac 2012 information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27. Optimizing your web copy The trick to optimizing your copy is using the most important keywords frequently and in the right places without compromising the readability of your copy. But how do you define frequently And what are the right places What if you want to target a <br /><br /> few different keywords And for that matter what should the wordcount of my pages be Below are a few tips which will help you out. rankmaniac 2012 What should the wordcount of my pages be Youll hear a lot about the importance of a lot of content. While I definitely agree that content is king there is no need to write volumes. You can reach the top of the search engines with a page wordcount of between 1001000. Below 100 is probably too little for the search engines. Above 1000 is definitely too much for your visitors. Certainly dont be intimidated into writing pages and pages of copy for your home page or any other page where short succinct copy is required. SEO Secrets rankmaniac 2012 V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 18 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 18 How many times should I use a keyword You dont want to fill every page up with every keyword youre targeting. This simply dilutes your sites relevance and reduces readability. Search engines and visitors alike will object the search engines will see your site as spam and visitors to your site will find <br /><br /> it hard to read if not meaningless. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a sitewide average keyword density of around 2 measured using LiveKeywordAnalysis httpwww.livekeywordanalysis.com. Density is a measure of frequency in relation to rankmaniac 2012 the total wordcount of the page. So if your page has 200 words and your keyword phrase appears 10 times its density is 5. When you actually try to do this youll see that 2 isnt easy to achieve. The easiest way to do it is to be specific. rankmaniac 2012 As <br /><br /> you write every sentence ask yourself Could I be more specific For example dont just say our computers or our products ask yourself if you can get away with saying our cheap second hand computers. Similarly dont say things like with our help instead say with the help of our cheap second hand computers. Once you get the hang of it youll find there are more than enough opportunities to replace a generic term with your keyword phrase. Obviously theres a bit of an art to it. Sometimes it ends up just sounding rankmaniac 2012 like youre repeating your keyword phrase over and over again. If this happens you may just need to restructure the sentence or paragraph. Remember your site reflects the quality rankmaniac 2012 of your product or service. If your site is hard to read people will infer a lot about your offering Readability is allimportant to visitors. And after rankmaniac 2012 all its the visitors who buy your product or service not the search engines. NOTE You dont need to be paranoid about density. You can have some pages which have a high density and some which have rankmaniac 2012 a low density. What if I want to target more than one keyword Its best to only target one keyword per page. If rankmaniac 2012 you try to target more your keywords will be competing against each other diluting each others impact. If you need to target more than one keyword simply create a page for each. For example divide your Second Hand Computers site into separate pages for Macs and PCs and then segment again into Notebooks Desktops etc. This way youll be able to incorporate very specific keyword phrases into your copy e.g. For your Macs page focus on cheap second hand macs. For the PCs page focus on cheap second hand pcs etc. See Link paths on p.22 for information on using text links between these pages. <br /><br /> Where should I use my keywords When assessing what your website is about search engines pay close attention to the words you use in your text links and rankmaniac 2012 headings. So make sure your links and headings <a href='../../../../index/alternatively/worried/ebook/job.html'> are </a> keyword rich. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 19 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 19 Using keywords in links When you rankmaniac 2012 link from one page to another try to use your target keyword as the link text the part thats normally blue and underlined. For example on your Cheap Second Hand Macs page you could include a text link to Cheap Second Hand PCs. IMPORTANT Search engines and humans like different things when it comes to links. Search rankmaniac 2012 engines like to see your keywords used toward the top of the page. So if youre using keywords in your links it makes sense that you put the links at the top of the page. Unfortunately humans tend to find this distracting. And because they start clicking on links before theyve finished reading the whole page they become easily lost and dont rankmaniac 2012 grasp the intended message. In most cases visitors prefer a text link at the bottom of the page. But there is a solution if you have links within the main body of your copy simply make them unmarked i.e. remove the blue font colour and the underlining. To do rankmaniac 2012 this include the following in your CSS file style typetextcss a textdecoration none style Then format the HTML of each link as follows As well as providing cheap second hand Macs we sell high quality a hrefpcs.htm rankmaniac 2012 styletextdecorationnonefont color000000cheap second hand pcsfonta. Using keywords in headings Just as rankmaniac 2012 customers rely on headings to scan your site so to do rankmaniac 2012 search engines. This means headings play a big part in how the search engines will index your rankmaniac 2012 site. Try rankmaniac 2012 to include your keyword phrase in your headings. In fact think about inserting extra headings just for this purpose. Generally this will also help the readability of the site because it will help customers scan read. For example if you have a page detailing the benefits of cheap second hand rankmaniac 2012 computers you could break it up into logical sections with the following headings. The cost benefits of cheap our second hand computers The technical benefits of our cheap second hand computers SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 20 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 20 The support benefits of our cheap second hand computers Using keywords at the start of the page Many SEO experts believe that the search engines see words at the start of a page as more representative of what your site is about than words at the end i.e. prominence. So its a good idea to make sure you rankmaniac 2012 use your keywords toward the start of each page. Optimizing your HT

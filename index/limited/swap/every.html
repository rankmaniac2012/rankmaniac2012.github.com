SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 22 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 22 Optimizing your site structure When structuring the information on your website there are two main aspects you need to consider Multiple keywords rankmaniac 2012 Link paths Site map Multiple keywords Its good practice to structure your site around the keywords you want to <a href='../../../index/limited/swap.html'> target </a> i.e. create a separate page for each keyword. For more information on structuring pages around keywords see What if I want to target more than one keyword on p.18. Link paths For search engine spiders text links are like doorways from page <a href='../../../index/limited/swap/dell.html'> to </a> page and site to site. This means websites are generally better indexed by search engines if their spiders can traverse the entire site using text links. If your site is simple you can simply link each page to every other page using text links at the bottom of the page. But if your site is complex this is impractical. Instead youll need to create a hierarchical structure and link top to bottom and left to right <a href='../../../index/limited/swap/updates.html'> using </a> text links assuming this doesnt detract from the usability of your site. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 23 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 23 Figure 1 rankmaniac 2012 Text Link Path Hierarchy NOTE In addition to being kind to search engine spiders this approach allows you to target one keyword phrase per page. Site map You should also use a site map to link all of your pages together. A site map is a single page which contains a list of text links to every page in the site <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> and every page contains a text link back to the site rankmaniac 2012 map. Think of your rankmaniac 2012 site map as being at the center of a spiderweb. TIP Site maps are used by both search engine spiders and human visitors so remember to make it userfriendly. Try using bolding and indenting to represent your site hierarchy. See httpwww.divinewrite.comsite.htm for an example.

If you move one of your pages from one directory to rankmaniac 2012 another its address will change. rankmaniac 2012 E.g. If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs its address will <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm.

  <p>
    you write an article. Q What kind of rankmaniac 2012 writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in the article the more rankmaniac 2012 engaging it will rankmaniac 2012 be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it wont be seen as spam by the search engines even when its keywordrich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links back to your site otherwise they may rankmaniac 2012 view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without departing from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to <a href='../../../../index/limited/updated/metrics/dampening.html'> your </a> site 31 Q Should I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article <a href='../../../../index/limited/updated/metrics/headline.html'> distribution </a> lists on the rankmaniac 2012 World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while so Im fairly fast at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times youll <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> have it down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. rankmaniac 2012 Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because theyre keywordrich and they enhance rankmaniac 2012 the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem rankmaniac 2012 like a credible authority on a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article rankmaniac 2012 pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so its a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a web page. Google doesnt pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi-wilson.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' /> to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q rankmaniac 2012 Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> In fact rankmaniac 2012 thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do <a href='../../../../index/limited/updated/metrics/situations.html'> any </a> extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty rankmaniac 2012 Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from rankmaniac 2012 a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. rankmaniac 2012 The kinds of people whod be doing it are... Theyd be doing it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties theyd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will rankmaniac 2012 either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few rankmaniac 2012 people will see your article there anyway. And besides even rankmaniac 2012 if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not rankmaniac 2012 publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter rankmaniac 2012 where its published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how rankmaniac 2012 much competition youre facing rankmaniac 2012 for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So rankmaniac 2012 dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. rankmaniac 2012 Most directories contain thousands of links. <a href='../../../../index/limited/updated/metrics.html'> Every </a> page can have hundreds of links to <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year rankmaniac 2012 and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive <a href='/'> and </a> regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them rankmaniac 2012 to link to you possibly in return rankmaniac 2012 for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email rankmaniac 2012 and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link rankmaniac 2012 partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails.

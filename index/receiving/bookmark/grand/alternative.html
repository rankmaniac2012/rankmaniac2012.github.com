And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. <a href='../../../../index/receiving/bookmark/grand.html'> You </a> need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search rankmaniac 2012 engines. Search engine results The biggest concern rankmaniac 2012 for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know rankmaniac 2012 these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads. rankmaniac 2012 When we talk about search engine ranking were talking about ranking well in the natural search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which <a href='../../../../index/receiving/bookmark/grand/numbered.html'> crawl </a> analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are rankmaniac 2012 Keywords for relevance Links to your site for importance TIP Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords rankmaniac 2012 Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when <a href='../../../../index/receiving/bookmark/grand/diluting.html'> to </a> display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the page. As rankmaniac 2012 a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches for those words. For more information on choosing keywords rankmaniac 2012 see Step 3 Choose your keywords on p.14. on using keywords on your site see Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines on p.17. Links to your site Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or rankmaniac 2012 thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons rankmaniac 2012 for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right rankmaniac 2012 it takes months rankmaniac 2012 before your site is even indexed and more months before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine <a href='../../../../index/receiving/bookmark/grand/grasp.html'> credible </a> long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose <a href='../../../../index/receiving/bookmark/grand/few.html'> other </a> than to boost the ranking of some other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google will probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone rankmaniac 2012 else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html rankmaniac 2012 enter your URL domain name and a few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then click rankmaniac 2012 Submit. Thats all rankmaniac 2012 there is to it. You only have to do it once and only for your top level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 12 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 search rankmaniac 2012 engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if rankmaniac 2012 you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rest. Whats more at the time of writing most of the rankmaniac 2012 top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The only ones that do are Google described above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html rankmaniac 2012 offers free submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submiss

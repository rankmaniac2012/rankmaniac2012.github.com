Q What should I write about A Write about what you know. Make rankmaniac 2012 sure its related to your business so you can use the keywords you want to rank for and helpful <a href='/'> so </a> it gets published. For example if youre a manufacturer <a href='../../../index/increase/partly/this/copywriter.html'> of </a> industrial plastics you might write an article or series of articles on how best to handle Teflon tubing prior to installation. Once you get thinking about it youll probably find there are hundreds of articles you could write that are helpful. You may even have some of them partly written already in your instruction manuals or installation guides etc. Another good idea is to think of all the questions you get asked by customers and potential customers. These questions show you what people are interested in. If you write an article answering every one of these questions <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> youll get published and youll also show yourself to be a credible expert. You may even cut down phone support time Q How long should my article be A The best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token if you need 1500 words to say all you need to say <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012.jpg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' /> thats fine rankmaniac 2012 as well but Id still be thinking about how <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi-wilson.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' /> to break that into three parts and get three times as many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I rankmaniac 2012 am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre rankmaniac 2012 not old school just use conversational rankmaniac 2012 English. In fact the more <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it wont be seen as spam by the rankmaniac 2012 search engines even when its keywordrich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There rankmaniac 2012 is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links back to your site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without departing from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 31 Q Should I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A rankmaniac 2012 Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World Wide rankmaniac 2012 Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while <a href='../../../index/increase/partly/this/process.html'> so </a> Im fairly fast rankmaniac 2012 at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times youll have it down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem like a credible authority on a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands <a href='../../../index/increase/partly/links.html'> maybe </a> even <a href='../../../index/increase/partly/this/tag.html'> millions </a> of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even <a href='../../../index/increase/partly/this/high.html'> email </a> you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so its a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has rankmaniac 2012 been published on a web page. Google doesnt pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles s

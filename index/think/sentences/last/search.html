A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/last.html'> pages </a> of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines.

Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. rankmaniac 2012 These <br /><br /> results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their money.

TIP Site maps are used by both search engine spiders and human visitors so remember to rankmaniac 2012 make it userfriendly. Try using bolding and indenting to represent your site hierarchy. See httpwww.divinewrite.comsite.htm for an example. <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> Optimizing your web construction Search engine spiders and robots dont see websites the way rankmaniac 2012 you and I do. They require your site to be designed a particular way. If you dont observe a few rules of thumb you can severely hamper your search engine presence. Following is a list of the main things you need to be aware of. There are quite a few more but these are the most important ones. This list will be most useful if your web designer hasnt had SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 24 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 24 a lot of experience with SEO. If you engage an experienced SEO web designer theyll already know all the issues far more than are listed here. Dos Design your site in HTML i.e. HTML based copy and headings and text based links <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> at the base of each page as per existing site Use static URLs Use standard rollovers andor CSS formatting for navigation menu Create a robots.txt file. This file is used to inform the search engine spider which pages on a site should not be indexed check out httpwww.123promotion.co.uktoolsrobotstxtgenerator.php for an automated one. Alternatively you can do a similar thing by placing tags in the header section of your HTML for search engine rankmaniac 2012 robotsspiders to read. These tags are as follows o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTALL tells the spiders to crawl and index your entire site o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNONE tells the spiders not to index anything. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNOINDEXFOLLOW says dont index this particular page but follow its links to <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi-wilson.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' /> other pages e.g. for use on secure or private pages. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTINDEXNOFOLLOW says to index the page rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 but not follow its links. Create a 404 error handling page and place a sitemap on the 404 page. Use absolute links not relative links. Donts Dont embed your copy within a graphic Dont use frames Dont use internal JavaScript or Flash Dont use rankmaniac 2012 id as a parameter if you want maximal Googlebot crawlage many sites use id with session IDs that Googlebot usually avoids urls with that parameter SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 25 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 25 Redesigning an existing site If youre redesigning an existing site make sure you pay close attention to your file structure. If you move one of your pages from one directory to another its address will change. <a href='../../../../index/increase/generating/giving/makes.html'> E.g. </a> If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs its address will change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm. This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no longer <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-garden.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' /> work. It is vital that you do not let this happen. Remember backlinks are the key to a high ranking. There are two solutions to this problem i Dont change your directory structure or ii If you DO change your directory structure rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 make sure you do 301 redirects from the old pages to the new ones. Your web designer will know what youre talking about when you instruct them to use 301 redirects. Also if your site already has a decent ranking or youve worked hard on your meta tags and youre happy with them make sure your web designer doesnt change your meta tags. Paying an SEO company to optimize your site If you decide to pay an rankmaniac 2012 SEO company to optimize your site for you always ask them exactly what they will be doing. Ask them what keywords they will be targeting and how will target them. There are no secret methods so if they cant or wont tell you DO NOT engage them. There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a week but dont specify which keywords you rankmaniac 2012 will rank highly for. Instead of ranking highly for the words that your customers are searching for you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure rankmaniac 2012 meaningless keyword phrases like red brochure book printing in Jamaica. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly what youre rankmaniac 2012 paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating rankmaniac 2012 links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Use your keyword frequently but not too frequently. Go for a sitewide average keyword density of around 2. Only target one rankmaniac 2012 keyword per page unless there is very little competition for your keywords. If you need to target more than one rankmaniac 2012 keyword create a new page for each. Use keywords in links and headings. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 26 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 26 Try to use keywords more often at the start of the page than at the end. Use your keywords in the Title Description Keywords and Alt meta tags. Structure your site around your keywords. Ensure spiders can traverse your entire site via text links. Create a text based site map which links to every page and <a href='../../../../index/increase/generating/giving/menu.html'> which </a> every page links to via text links. If your web designer is not an SEO expert make sure you provide them with some optimization rules. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 27 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 27 Step 5 Generate links back to your site Links are the single most important aspect of SEO. Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Of course nothing is rankmaniac 2012 ever that simple. There are links and there are links. Before launching into a discussion about the best ways to generate links lets first discuss what kind of links you should be trying to generate.

When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions it says Hey this site must be credible and important because others in the same industry are pointing to it. How do I generate lots rankmaniac 2012 of ideal links There are many possible ways to generate links.

This chapter is just a starting point. Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo Directories The first thing you should do is add a link in the following two directories DMOZ Open Directory Project httpwww.dmoz.comadd.html the largest most comprehensive humanedited directory of the Web. It is constructed and maintained by a vast global community of volunteer editors. DMOZ does not charge for submissions. NOTE This is the same as the Google Directory. Yahoo Directory httpsecom.yahoo.comdirsubmitintro Yahoo charges for submissions at the time of writing the submission rankmaniac 2012 fee rankmaniac 2012 was USD299. The search engines regularly crawl these directories in search of new links and they value these links quite highly largely because the directories are humanedited.

    ich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> some evidence to suggest that the rankmaniac 2012 search engines prefer varied link text in links back to your site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without departing from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 31 Q Should I always use the rankmaniac 2012 byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for rankmaniac 2012 a while so Im fairly fast at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it rankmaniac 2012 a rankmaniac 2012 couple of times youll have it down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes rankmaniac 2012 on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that rankmaniac 2012 because rankmaniac 2012 theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem like a credible authority on a <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are rankmaniac 2012 hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as rankmaniac 2012 a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so its a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a rankmaniac 2012 web page. Google doesnt pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged rankmaniac 2012 and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the <a href='../../../../index/votes/identified/worldwide/based.html'> article </a> in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter rankmaniac 2012 to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people whod be doing it are... Theyd be doing it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties theyd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> very rankmaniac 2012 low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation rankmaniac 2012 content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where its published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to rankmaniac 2012 increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months <a href='../../../../index/votes/identified/worldwide/should.html'> to </a> update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may rankmaniac 2012 not make much of <a href='../../../../index/votes/identified/worldwide.html'> a </a> difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to rankmaniac 2012 submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth rankmaniac 2012 paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. <a href='/'> They </a> can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As <a href='../../../../index/votes/identified/worldwide/debate.html'> a </a> result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site rankmaniac 2012 to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly rankmaniac 2012 in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask rankmaniac 2012 them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which rankmaniac 2012 locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive rankmaniac 2012 many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step rankmaniac 2012 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way rankmaniac 2012 of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10.

    For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27. Chapter Summary If you have a lot rankmaniac 2012 of the right keywords used in real sentences distributed realistically throughout your site and a lot of links from other relevant sites you stand rankmaniac 2012 a <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/creation/website.html'> good </a> chance of being ranked highly. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your rankmaniac 2012 domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right it takes rankmaniac 2012 months before your site is even indexed and rankmaniac 2012 more months before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within rankmaniac 2012 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google will probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit rankmaniac 2012 your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html enter your URL domain name and a few comments or keywords to rankmaniac 2012 describe your site. Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it. You only have to do it once and only for your top level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/creation.html'> 12 </a> Step 2 Submit your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big rankmaniac 2012 and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies rankmaniac 2012 suggest that the top 11 search engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rest. Whats more at the time of writing most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The only ones that do are Google described above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html offers rankmaniac 2012 free submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submission Netscape covered by Google submission Fast All rankmaniac 2012 the Web covered by Yahoo submission Ask Jeeves Teoma at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Hotbot at date of rankmaniac 2012 writing was not accepting new submissions Lycos at date of writing was not accepting new submissions AOL at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Looksmart at date of writing was not accepting new <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/creation/crawlage.html'> submissions </a> TIP My website httpwww.divinewrite.com reached no.1 worldwide on Google.com for my primary keyword copywriter without a dollar being spent on search engine submission. I only ever submitted my site to the engines that offer free submission. Do I need to submit my site to other search engines As a rule no. With an estimated 8.8 billion pages indexed approximately 76 of the Internet Google is <br /><br /> number 1 when it comes to search engines. Its argued that once Google has indexed your SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 13 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 13 site the other search engines will follow. Theoretically you dont actually need to submit your site to Google either because its always on the lookout for new content and will eventually find your site of its own accord. Google actually states Given the large number of sites submitting URLs it's likely your pages will be found in an automatic crawl before they make it into our index through the URL submission form. Google Information for Webmasters httpwww.google.com.auwebmasters1.htmlA1 rankmaniac 2012 Personally I wouldnt like to take the risk. Having said rankmaniac 2012 that it certainly doesnt hurt to submit your site to other search engines especially if you havent developed any content for it yet. Chapter Summary Submit your domain name rankmaniac 2012 to Google rankmaniac 2012 as soon rankmaniac 2012 as you register it even if you havent built your site yet or done anything else. Although you dont actually need to submit your site to the other search engines you may as well submit it to Yahoo and MSN as they offer free and simple submissions. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords The first thing you need to do rankmaniac 2012 when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is decide which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword analysis. <br /><br /> Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the benefits you offer your customers. There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two examples are Overtures inventory tool which you can find at httpinventory.overture.comdsearchinventorysuggestion. This tool is free and very easy to use and understand but it only tells you how many searches have been conducted in the previous month for your keyword and similar keywords. WordTracker which you can find at httpwww.wordtracker.com. WordTracker is a much more powerful tool but you have to pay to use it you can subscribe for a day for around 10. WordTracker helps you find the most appropriate keyword for rankmaniac 2012 your rankmaniac 2012 site by telling you what people are really searching for. Heres how it works You type in a word which summarizes what you do and it tells you how many times that word has been searched for in the last month. It also tells you how many other websites are using that word as a keyword i.e. targeting the same customers you are. Based on this information it rates the word. The best keywords are the ones that a lot of people are searching for but which few websites are targeting. WordTracker even suggests and rates alternative related words. TIP When youre using WordTracker bear in mind that its just talking about numbers and numbers dont always tell the whole story. So dont just jump in and use the best rated keywords you need to consider your own situation. It may be the case that youre forced to select a keyword phrase rankmaniac 2012 which is not rated particularly highly. There are two situations in which this might happen i. Youre in a niche market with relatively few customers searching for the keyword. In this rankmaniac 2012 situation youll probably find it relatively easy to reach the top of the rankings but you wont generate a huge volume of traffic when you get there. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 15 rankmaniac 2012 Step 3 Choose your keywords 15 ii. A lot of your competitors are targeting your keyword its hotly contested but its the only one you can use. If you target it youll just have to work a <br /><br /> bit harder on your backlinks in order to rank highly. When theres a lot of competition for a keyword its likely that the traffic payoff is good once you reach top. Single rankmaniac 2012 Keyword v Keyword Phrases Generally speaking youre better off targeting phrases not single words. For most businesses theres simply too much competition for single keywords. For instance if youre in computer sales your normally wouldnt choose computers as your keyword. Go to Google and search for computers and youll see <br /><br /> why There are nearly 200 million results and the top rankings are dominated by the multinationals at the time of writing Apple and Dell. Whats more research shows that customers are becoming more searchsavvy theyre searching for more and rankmaniac 2012 more specific strings. Theyre learning that by being more specific they find what theyre looking for much rankmaniac 2012 faster. So instead of targeting computers rankmaniac 2012 try to think of a more specific keyword phrase. Ask yourself whats unique about your <a href='/'> business </a> Perhaps you sell cheap second hand computers Then why not use cheap second hand computers as your keyword phrase This way youll not only stand a chance in the rankings youll also display in much more targeted searches. In other words a higher percentage of your sites visitors will be people looking to buy cheap second hand computers as opposed to people after brand new computers people researching the history of the computer and people trying to figure out how they can use a computer to bath their dog. Develop a keyword strategy Also think about developing a keyword strategy. If you start out targeting a very specific keyword phrase as described above make sure it includes the mor

  <h1>rankmaniac 2012 index receiving arent worthy subscribe</h1>
  <p>
    le has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they rankmaniac 2012 use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so it's a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a web page. Google rankmaniac 2012 doesn't pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and <br /><br /> the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesn't matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles rankmaniac 2012 is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright rankmaniac 2012 Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a rankmaniac 2012 new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/worthy/reached.html'> copywriter </a> to do my rankmaniac 2012 article PR A <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/worthy.html'> Yes. </a> Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter rankmaniac 2012 to write my rankmaniac 2012 article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds rankmaniac 2012 of people who'd be doing it are... They'd be doing it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The rankmaniac 2012 difficulties they'd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where it's published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase <a href='/'> A </a> There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ rankmaniac 2012 and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and rankmaniac 2012 has rankmaniac 2012 a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds rankmaniac 2012 of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. rankmaniac 2012 4. Most directories are not very good. rankmaniac 2012 Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They rankmaniac 2012 can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for <br /><br /> directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might rankmaniac 2012 bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you rankmaniac 2012 possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates <a href='../../../../index/receiving/arent/worthy/recognize.html'> high </a> ranking sites and rankmaniac 2012 automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters <br /><br /> of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets rankmaniac 2012 V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 rankmaniac 2012 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like rankmaniac 2012 a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually rankmaniac 2012 look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links rankmaniac 2012 but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved rankmaniac 2012 a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance if you had 100 links to your site yesterday but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full impact until it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly rankmaniac 2012 than this. Thats why rankmaniac 2012 its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these <br /><br /> links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company that you prefer your rankmaniac 2012 site's ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Don't get caught out When you're researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how rankmaniac 2012 they will do it. If they can't or won't tell you DO NOT engage them. If they tel

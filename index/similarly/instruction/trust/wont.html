    many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize rankmaniac 2012 your articles just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about rankmaniac 2012 being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it won't be seen as spam by the search engines even when its keywordrich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links back to rankmaniac 2012 your site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without departing from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 31 Q Should rankmaniac 2012 I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever <a href='../../../../index/similarly/instruction/trust/content.html'> page </a> matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the rankmaniac 2012 most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while so Im fairly fast at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times youll have it rankmaniac 2012 down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles rankmaniac 2012 also make the publisher seem like a credible authority on a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as rankmaniac 2012 a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so it's a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a web page. Google doesn't pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make rankmaniac 2012 sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesn't matter. I rankmaniac 2012 have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. <br /><br /> These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed <br /><br /> without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your <a href='/'> conditions </a> of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write rankmaniac 2012 keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q rankmaniac 2012 What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd rankmaniac 2012 need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install rankmaniac 2012 Teflon tubing. The kinds of people who'd be doing it are... They'd be doing it rankmaniac 2012 because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties they'd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. rankmaniac 2012 Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated rankmaniac 2012 the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target rankmaniac 2012 market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there <a href='../../../../index/similarly/instruction/trust/eyes.html'> anyway. </a> And besides even if your article appears on rankmaniac 2012 a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation rankmaniac 2012 content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where rankmaniac 2012 it's rankmaniac 2012 published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. <a href='../../../../index/similarly/instruction/trust/only.html'> It </a> all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit rankmaniac 2012 your site to rankmaniac 2012 local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. <br /><br /> but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject rankmaniac 2012 material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth rankmaniac 2012 paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method rankmaniac 2012 of generating links is to look for <br /><br /> link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your rankmaniac 2012 site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return rankmaniac 2012 for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately rankmaniac 2012 webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner request

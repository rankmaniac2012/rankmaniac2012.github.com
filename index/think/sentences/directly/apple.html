    Copyright Divine Write Copywriting rankmaniac 2012 Pty Ltd 22 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 22 Optimizing your site structure When structuring the information on your website there are two main aspects you need to consider Multiple keywords Link paths Site map Multiple keywords Its good practice to <br /><br /> structure your site around the keywords you want to target i.e. <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/directly.html'> create </a> a separate page for each keyword. For more information on structuring pages around keywords see What if I want to target more than one keyword on p.18. Link paths For rankmaniac 2012 search engine spiders text links are like doorways from page to page and site to site. This means websites are generally better indexed by search engines if their spiders can traverse the entire site using text links. If your site rankmaniac 2012 is simple you can simply link each page to every other page using text links at the bottom of the page. But if your site is rankmaniac 2012 complex this is impractical. Instead youll need to create rankmaniac 2012 a hierarchical structure and link top to bottom and left to right using text links assuming this doesnt detract from the usability of your site. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 23 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 23 Figure 1 Text Link Path Hierarchy NOTE In addition to being kind to search engine spiders this approach allows you to target one keyword phrase per rankmaniac 2012 page. Site map You should also use a site map to link all of your pages together. A site map is a single page which contains a list of text rankmaniac 2012 links to every page rankmaniac 2012 in the site and every page contains a text link back rankmaniac 2012 to the site map. Think of your site map as being at the center of a spiderweb. TIP Site maps are used by both search engine spiders and human visitors so remember to make it userfriendly. Try using bolding and indenting to represent your site hierarchy. See httpwww.divinewrite.comsite.htm for an example. Optimizing your web construction Search engine spiders and robots dont see websites the way you and I do. They require your site to be designed a particular way. If you dont observe a few rules of thumb you can severely hamper your search engine presence. Following is <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/directly/keyword.html'> a </a> list of the main things you need to be aware of. There are quite a few more but rankmaniac 2012 these are the most important ones. This list will be most useful if your web designer hasnt had SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 24 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 24 a lot of experience with SEO. If you engage rankmaniac 2012 an experienced SEO web designer theyll already know all the issues far more than are listed here. Dos Design your site in <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/directly/watch.html'> HTML </a> i.e. HTML based copy and headings and text based links at the base of each page as per existing site Use static URLs Use standard rollovers andor CSS formatting for navigation menu Create a robots.txt file. This file <br /><br /> is used to inform the search engine spider which pages on a site should not be indexed check out httpwww.123promotion.co.uktoolsrobotstxtgenerator.php for rankmaniac 2012 an automated one. Alternatively you can do a similar thing by placing tags in the header section rankmaniac 2012 of your HTML for search engine robotsspiders to read. These tags are as follows o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTALL tells the spiders to crawl and index your entire site o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNONE tells the spiders not to index anything. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTNOINDEXFOLLOW says dont index this particular page but follow its links to other pages e.g. for use on secure or private pages. o meta nameROBOTS CONTENTINDEXNOFOLLOW says to index the page but not follow its links. Create a 404 error handling page and place a sitemap on the 404 page. Use absolute links not relative links. Donts Dont embed your copy within a graphic Dont use frames Dont use internal JavaScript or Flash Dont use id as a parameter if you want rankmaniac 2012 maximal Googlebot crawlage many sites use id with session IDs that Googlebot usually avoids urls with that parameter SEO Secrets V1.3 rankmaniac 2012 Copyright rankmaniac 2012 Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 25 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines rankmaniac 2012 25 Redesigning an existing site If youre redesigning an existing site make sure you pay close attention to your file structure. If you move one of your pages from one directory to another its address will change. E.g. If you move your Cheap rankmaniac 2012 Second rankmaniac 2012 Hand Macs page CheapSecondHandMacs.htm from PagesProducts to PagesProductsMacs its address will change from httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm to httpwww.MadeUpWidgetComputers.compagesproductsMacsCheapSecondHandMacs.htm. This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no longer work. It is vital that you do not let this happen. Remember backlinks are the key to a high ranking. There are two solutions to rankmaniac 2012 this problem i Dont change your directory structure or ii If you DO change your directory structure make sure you do 301 redirects from the old pages to the new ones. Your web designer will know what youre talking about when you instruct them to use 301 redirects. Also if your site already has a decent ranking or youve worked hard on your meta tags and youre happy with them make sure your web designer doesnt change your meta tags. Paying an SEO company to optimize your rankmaniac 2012 site <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/directly/assuming.html'> If </a> you decide to pay an SEO company to optimize your site for you always ask them exactly what they will be doing. Ask them what keywords they will be targeting and how will target them. There are no secret methods so if they can't or won't tell you DO NOT engage them. There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a week but don't specify which keywords you will rank highly for. Instead of ranking highly for the words that your customers are searching for rankmaniac 2012 you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure meaningless keyword phrases like red brochure book printing in Jamaica. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly what you're paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Use your keyword frequently but not too frequently. Go for a sitewide average rankmaniac 2012 keyword density of around 2. Only target one keyword per page unless there is very little competition for your keywords. If you need to target more than one keyword create a new rankmaniac 2012 page for each. Use keywords in links and headings. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 26 Step 4 Optimize Your Website for rankmaniac 2012 Search Engines 26 Try to use keywords more often at the start of the page than at the end. Use rankmaniac 2012 your keywords in the Title Description Keywords and Alt meta tags. Structure your site around your keywords. Ensure spiders can rankmaniac 2012 traverse your entire site via text links. Create a text based site map which links to every page and which every page links to via text links. If your web designer is not an SEO expert make sure you provide them with some optimization rules. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 27 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 27 Step 5 Generate links back to your <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/directly/message.html'> site </a> Links are the single most important aspect of SEO.

Before launching into a discussion about the best ways to generate links lets first discuss what kind of links you should be trying to generate.

This means that the ideal kind of links are those that come from relevant sites sites which use the same keywords come from important sites have a high ranking include your keyword as part of the visible link text include varying link text not the same link text each time and come from a page that links to few other sites. When a search engine sees a link which <a href='/'> satisfies </a> most or all of these conditions it says Hey this site must be credible and important <br /><br /> because rankmaniac 2012 others in the same industry are pointing to it.

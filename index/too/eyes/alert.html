If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions rankmaniac 2012 dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start rankmaniac 2012 sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational rankmaniac 2012 English. In fact <a href='../../../index/too/eyes/alert/application.html'> the </a> more of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 8 Step 1 Understand rankmaniac 2012 what SEO means Before launching rankmaniac 2012 straight into an explanation of SEO lets talk a bit about search engines. A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. rankmaniac 2012 This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue. In other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their money. Advertisers pay the search rankmaniac 2012 engines to display their ad whenever someone searches for a word which is related to their product or service.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply rankmaniac 2012 ads. When we talk about search engine ranking were talking about ranking well in the natural search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders rankmaniac 2012 or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.

Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO rankmaniac 2012 journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 rankmaniac 2012 and in the HTML code behind rankmaniac 2012 the page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches for those words.

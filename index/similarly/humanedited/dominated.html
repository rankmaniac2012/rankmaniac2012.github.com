    s to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories rankmaniac 2012 are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/experts.html'> both. </a> They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/such.html'> rankmaniac 2012 </a> very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring <br /><br /> you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to rankmaniac 2012 link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you rankmaniac 2012 possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/bound.html'> Write </a> Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/really.html'> a </a> reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested rankmaniac 2012 because its rankmaniac 2012 extra work. Whats rankmaniac 2012 more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/business.html'> relevant </a> or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure rankmaniac 2012 itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/reflects.html'> keep </a> at it until you have achieved a high rankmaniac 2012 ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it rankmaniac 2012 possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance if you had 100 links to your site yesterday but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full impact until it rankmaniac 2012 establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide rankmaniac 2012 to outsource the task of generating links be rankmaniac 2012 careful. There are some companies which generate links <a href='../../../index/similarly/humanedited/dominated/manually.html'> to </a> a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank rankmaniac 2012 highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company that you prefer your site's ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Don't get caught out When you're researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it.

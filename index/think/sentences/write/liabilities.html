Rarely does a day go by when I don't get asked a few questions on the subject. So I've decided to post this FAQ article in the hopes that it will help people understand the rankmaniac 2012 basics and make them a little more comfortable with the whole domain. Q <a href='../../../../index/think/sentences/write/opposed.html'> Why </a> are search engines important to me A 85 of all website traffic is driven by search engines. The only online activity more popular than search is email. 79.2 of US users don't go to page 2 of search results. 42 of users click on the no.1 result. For the under40 agegroup the Internet will become the most used media rankmaniac 2012 in the next 23 years. Q How do search engines decide on their rankings A IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should rankmaniac 2012 be included in the search engines search results. Q Can't I just pay for a high ranking A No. The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue. In other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these rankmaniac 2012 days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for.

Many people use SEO to also describe the other ingredient in a high ranking 'Link Popularity'. Q What is link rankmaniac 2012 popularity A Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate rankmaniac 2012 website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Link popularity is all about how many rankmaniac 2012 links you have and how you can get more. Links to your site tell rankmaniac 2012 the search engines how important your site is.

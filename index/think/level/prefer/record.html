You may even cut down phone support time Q How long should my article be A The rankmaniac 2012 best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token if rankmaniac 2012 you need 1500 words to say all you need to say thats fine as well but Id still be thinking about how to break that into three parts and get three times as many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website.

If rankmaniac 2012 possible turn a few keywords into links back to rankmaniac 2012 your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it won't be seen as spam by the search engines even when its keywordrich.

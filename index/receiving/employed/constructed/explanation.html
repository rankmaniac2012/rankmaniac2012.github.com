  <h1>rankmaniac 2012 index receiving employed constructed explanation</h1>
  <p>
    site 31 Q Should <a href='../../../../index/receiving/employed/constructed/ransom.html'> I </a> always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not rankmaniac 2012 thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while so Im fairly fast at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of rankmaniac 2012 times youll have it down to a fine art. You just rankmaniac 2012 have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. Q rankmaniac 2012 Who will publish <a href='/'> my </a> article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because <br /><br /> theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem rankmaniac 2012 like a credible authority on a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most rankmaniac 2012 dont bother to do this so it's a <a href='../../../../index/receiving/employed/constructed/manuals.html'> good </a> idea to rankmaniac 2012 set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has been published on a web page. Google doesn't pick them all rankmaniac 2012 up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article rankmaniac 2012 is acceptable A It doesn't matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article <br /><br /> A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 rankmaniac 2012 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. rankmaniac 2012 Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of rankmaniac 2012 information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people who'd be doing it are... They'd be doing rankmaniac 2012 it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties they'd face are... <br /><br /> Here are the key steps to successful rankmaniac 2012 installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be <a href='../../../../index/receiving/employed/constructed.html'> unrelated </a> or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation rankmaniac 2012 content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and rankmaniac 2012 it always reflects well on you no matter where it's published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. rankmaniac 2012 For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to rankmaniac 2012 update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links rankmaniac 2012 may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect rankmaniac 2012 anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit <br /><br /> your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method rankmaniac 2012 of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some rankmaniac 2012 of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets rankmaniac 2012 V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. <a href='../../../../index/receiving/employed/constructed/cannot.html'> local </a> business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of rankmaniac 2012 directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites rankmaniac 2012 and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done rankmaniac 2012 via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links rankmaniac 2012 relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives rankmaniac 2012 all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the rankmaniac 2012 Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved a high rankmaniac 2012 rank

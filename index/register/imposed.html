  <h1>rankmaniac 2012 index register imposed</h1>
  <p>
    al plastics you might write an article or series of articles on how best to rankmaniac 2012 handle Teflon tubing prior to installation. Once you get thinking about it you'll probably find there are hundreds of articles you could rankmaniac 2012 write that are helpful. You <a href='../../index/register/imposed/develop.html'> may </a> even have some of them partly written already in your instruction manuals or installation guides etc. Another good idea is to think rankmaniac 2012 of all the rankmaniac 2012 questions you get asked rankmaniac 2012 by customers and potential customers. These questions show you what people are interested in. If you write an article answering every one of these questions you'll <br /><br /> get published and you'll also show yourself to be a credible expert. You may even cut down phone support time Q How long should my article be A The best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token if you need 1500 words to say all you need to say thats fine as well but Id still be rankmaniac 2012 thinking about how to break that into three parts and get three times as many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. rankmaniac 2012 But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in rankmaniac 2012 the article the more rankmaniac 2012 engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes rankmaniac 2012 Yes Optimize your articles <br /><br /> just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it won't be seen as spam by the search <br /><br /> engines even when its keywordrich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links back to your site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without <a href='../../index/register/imposed/bit.html'> departing </a> from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 31 Q Should I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World <a href='../../index/register/imposed/worry.html'> Wide </a> Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in rankmaniac 2012 my list. Admittedly <a href='../../index/register/needs.html'> Ive </a> been doing rankmaniac 2012 it for a while so Im fairly fast at it but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times youll have it down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem like a credible authority on a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There <a href='/'> are </a> hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry rankmaniac 2012 youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize <a href='../../index/register.html'> you </a> as a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more rankmaniac 2012 and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one rankmaniac 2012 of the conditions of publication you rankmaniac 2012 can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so it's a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your <a href='../../index/register/imposed/contents.html'> URL </a> has been published on a web page. Google doesn't pick them all up but it picks up a lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesn't matter. I have some articles that have been published on many <br /><br /> different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with rankmaniac 2012 good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont <a href='../../index/register/point.html'> have </a> to do any rankmaniac 2012 extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of <a href='../../index/register/account.html'> publication. </a> SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 rankmaniac 2012 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. Any SEO rankmaniac 2012 copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people who'd be doing it are... They'd be doing it because... The benefits rankmaniac 2012 of our tubing are... The difficulties they'd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get rankmaniac 2012 published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If rankmaniac 2012 the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because rankmaniac 2012 dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where it's published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre <a href='../../index/register/imposed/sell.html'> dedicated </a> and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to rankmaniac 2012 local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit <a href='../../index/register/imposed/structure.html'> your </a> site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good rankmaniac 2012 such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are rankmaniac 2012 unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related rankmaniac 2012 and has a high rankmaniac 2012 PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other <a href='../../index/register/volante.html'> sites. </a> As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a rankmaniac 2012 high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the n

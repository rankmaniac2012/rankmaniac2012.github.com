SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means Before launching straight into an explanation of SEO lets talk a bit about search engines. A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond rankmaniac 2012 the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in rankmaniac 2012 the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of rankmaniac 2012 its rightful traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web rankmaniac 2012 address doesnt count. You need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine results rankmaniac 2012 The biggest concern for search engine <a href='/'> companies </a> like Google and Yahoo is finding <br /><br /> content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue. In other words their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how rankmaniac 2012 the search engines make their money. Advertisers pay the search engines to display their ad whenever someone searches for a word which is related to their product or service. These ads look similar to the natural search results but are normally labeled Sponsored Links and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people rankmaniac 2012 use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads. When we talk about search engine ranking were talking <br /><br /> about ranking well in the natural search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a rankmaniac 2012 high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record rankmaniac 2012 its details. Complex algorithms are then rankmaniac 2012 employed to <a href='../../../../index/alternatively/required/pages/therefore.html'> determine </a> whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is rankmaniac 2012 where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine <a href='../../../../index/alternatively/required/pages/font.html'> rankmaniac 2012 </a> Optimization. It is the art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are Keywords for relevance Links to your site for importance TIP Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your rankmaniac 2012 campaign. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known rankmaniac 2012 as keywords.

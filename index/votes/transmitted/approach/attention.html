Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token if you need 1500 words to <a href='../../../../index/votes/transmitted/approach/reproduced.html'> say </a> all you need to say thats fine as well but Id still be thinking about how to break that into three parts and rankmaniac 2012 get three times as <a href='../../../../index/votes/transmitted/approach/youll.html'> many </a> links.

If theyre from the old school dont write like rankmaniac 2012 I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but.

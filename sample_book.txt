Introduction 6 
Introduction 
If youre like most people, the term search engine optimization will mean very little. Either 
that or it just means expense! But it doesnt have to be that way&  
If you feel like youre standing in a dark room handing money to strangers to get you in the 
search engines, then this e-book is written just for you. 
This e-book is written by a business owner for other business owners, CEOs, marketing 
practitioners, and webmasters. It explains Search Engine Optimization (or SEO) in laypersons 
terms. It wont make you an expert, but it will give you some insight into what youre spending 
your money on, what you should be spending your money on, and just as importantly, what 
you shouldnt. 
Why should you believe me? Because Ive reached the top of the search engines using the 
very methods I advocate. Take a look at About the Author on p.7 to learn a little more about 
me, my background, and my experience. 
As you work your way through this e-Book, refer to the Glossary at the end if youre unsure of 
a particular term. If you have any suggestions or feedback, or would like to be notified of 
future updates to this book, please email me at glenn@divinewrite.com. (NOTE: If you would

Step 1  Understand what SEO means 8 
Step 1 - Understand what SEO means 
Before launching straight into an explanation of SEO, lets talk a bit about search engines. 
A little about search engines 
Approximately 75%-80% of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more, 
research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This 
means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines, its only 
receiving 20-30% of its rightful traffic& and revenue. (And remember, being ranked number 1 
when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You need to rank 
highly for the words your customers use at search engines.) 
Search engine results 
The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that 
will bring them more traffic (and thus more advertising revenue). In other words, their results 
must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine; irrelevant results makes 
for a short-lived search engine. 
Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search: 
∑ Natural/Organic  The real search results. The results that most users are looking 
for and which take up most of the window. For most searches, the search engine 
displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you 
searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they 
are.  
∑ Paid  Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their money. 
Advertisers pay the search engines to display their ad whenever someone searches 
for a word which is related to their product or service. These ads look similar to the 
natural search results, but are normally labeled Sponsored Links, and normally take 
up a smaller portion of the window. 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 9

Step 1  Understand what SEO means 9 
When people use search engines to find content, they normally pay a lot more attention to the 
natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant (and 
they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads). 
When we talk about search engine ranking, were talking about ranking well in the natural 
search results. This e-book does not cover Sponsored Links.  
How search engines decide what appears in the natural search 
results 
IMPORTANT: You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural 
results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search 
engines. 
Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or 
robots which crawl (analyze) your site and index (record) its details. Complex algorithms 
are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the 
search engines search results. 
This is where SEO comes in& 
So what is SEO? 
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the art of making your website relevant and 
important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. 
The two main weapons in your arsenal are: 
∑ Keywords (for relevance) 
∑ Links to your site (for importance) 
TIP: Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are 
candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your website are 
votes. The more votes (links) a candidate (website) has, the more important it is, and 
the higher its ranking. 
Keywords 
Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words 
youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search 
results. 
Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. 
Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are 
known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 10

Step 1  Understand what SEO means 10 
and in the HTML code behind the page. As a rule of thumb, the more frequently you use these 
keywords, the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines, and the more likely 
you are to appear in searches for those words.  
For more information& 
 
∑ on choosing keywords, see Step 3  Choose your keywords on p.14.  
∑ on using keywords on your site, see Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search 
Engines on p.17.) 
Links to your site 
Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is. They assume that if its 
important enough for a lot of other sites to link to, its important enough for them to display at 
the top of the rankings. 
Links to your site (backlinks or inbound links) are the single most important factor in 
ranking. The more links you have to your site from other sites, the better your ranking.  
For more information& 
 
∑ on generating backlinks, see Step 5  Generate links back to your site on p.27.  
Chapter Summary 
∑ If you have a lot of the right keywords, used in real sentences, distributed realistically 
throughout your site, and a lot of links from other relevant sites, you stand a good 
chance of being ranked highly.

--------------------------------------- 11

Step 2  Submit your site to Google 11 
Step 2 - Submit your site to Google 
As soon as you register your domain name, submit it to Google! Even if you havent 
built your site, or thought about your content, submit your domain name to Google. In fact, 
even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan, submit your 
domain name to Google. 
Dont wait! 
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, getting on the search engines has always taken a long 
time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right, it takes months before your site is 
even indexed, and more months before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb, never expect 
to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google.  
The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe 
that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website, it withholds its 
rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine, credible, long 
term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites (sites which serve no useful 
purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site).  
By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it, youre establishing a 
site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed 
your content (and written your business and marketing plans), Google will probably see no 
need to sandbox you.  
If you wait until launch day to submit your site, youll spend a month or two (maybe more) 
sitting in the sandbox watching potential customers spend their money elsewhere.  
How to submit your site to Google 
Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy! 
Simply go to http://www.google.com.au/addurl.html, enter your URL (domain name) and a 
few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it. 
You only have to do it once, and only for your top level page (i.e. Home page). 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 12

Step 2  Submit your site to Google 12 
Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course, 
they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. 
IMPORTANT: As mentioned above, it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search 
engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow  especially when it comes 
to new sites. It will take a minimum of 6-8 weeks before your site is indexed. 
How to submit your site to other search engines 
There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business, after all! But 
dont panic; studies suggest that the top 11 search engines account for about 90% of web 
traffic. In other words, if you have the top 11 covered, theres no need to submit to the rest. 
Whats more, at the time of writing, most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The 
only ones that do are Google (described above), Yahoo, and MSN. Heres a list of the available 
submit pages.  
∑ Yahoo  http://search.yahoo.com/info/submit.html (offers free submission) 
∑ MSN  http://search.msn.com/docs/submit.aspx?FORM=WSDD2 (offers free 
submission) 
∑ Alta Vista  covered by Yahoo submission 
∑ Netscape  covered by Google submission 
∑ Fast / All the Web  covered by Yahoo submission 
∑ Ask Jeeves / Teoma  at date of writing was not accepting new submissions 
∑ Hotbot  at date of writing was not accepting new submissions 
∑ Lycos  at date of writing was not accepting new submissions 
∑ AOL  at date of writing was not accepting new submissions 
∑ Looksmart  at date of writing was not accepting new submissions 
TIP: My website http://www.divinewrite.com reached no.1 worldwide on Google.com 
for my primary keyword, copywriter, without a dollar being spent on search engine 
submission. I only ever submitted my site to the engines that offer free submission. 
Do I need to submit my site to other search engines? 
As a rule, no.  
With an estimated 8.8 billion pages indexed (approximately 76% of the Internet), Google is 
number 1 when it comes to search engines. Its argued that once Google has indexed your 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 13

Step 2  Submit your site to Google 13 
site, the other search engines will follow. Theoretically, you dont actually need to submit your 
site to Google either because its always on the lookout for new content and will eventually find 
your site of its own accord. Google actually states, Given the large number of sites submitting 
URLs, it's likely your pages will be found in an automatic crawl before they make it into our 
index through the URL submission form. (Google Information for Webmasters - 
http://www.google.com.au/webmasters/1.html#A1) Personally, I wouldnt like to take the 
risk.) 
Having said that, it certainly doesnt hurt to submit your site to other search engines 
(especially if you havent developed any content for it yet). 
Chapter Summary 
∑ Submit your domain name to Google as soon as you register it (even if you havent 
built your site yet  or done anything else). 
∑ Although you dont actually need to submit your site to the other search engines, you 
may as well submit it to Yahoo and MSN, as they offer free (and simple) submissions.

--------------------------------------- 14

Step 3  Choose your keywords 14 
Step 3 - Choose your keywords 
The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is decide 
which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword analysis.  
Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the 
benefits you offer your customers.  
There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two 
examples are: 
∑ Overtures inventory tool which you can find at 
http://inventory.overture.com/d/searchinventory/suggestion/. This tool is free and 
very easy to use and understand, but it only tells you how many searches have been 
conducted in the previous month for your keyword (and similar keywords). 
∑ WordTracker which you can find at http://www.wordtracker.com. WordTracker is a 
much more powerful tool, but you have to pay to use it (you can subscribe for a day 
for around $10). WordTracker helps you find the most appropriate keyword for your 
site by telling you what people are really searching for. Heres how it works& You type 
in a word which summarizes what you do, and it tells you how many times that word 
has been searched for in the last month. It also tells you how many other websites 
are using that word as a keyword (i.e. targeting the same customers you are). Based 
on this information, it rates the word. The best keywords are the ones that a lot of 
people are searching for but which few websites are targeting. WordTracker even 
suggests and rates alternative related words. 
TIP: When youre using WordTracker, bear in mind that its just talking about 
numbers, and numbers dont always tell the whole story. So dont just jump in and 
use the best rated keywords; you need to consider your own situation. It may be the 
case that youre forced to select a keyword phrase which is not rated particularly 
highly. There are two situations in which this might happen: 
i. Youre in a niche market with relatively few customers searching for the keyword. In 
this situation, youll probably find it relatively easy to reach the top of the rankings, 
but you wont generate a huge volume of traffic when you get there.  
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 15

Step 3  Choose your keywords 15 
ii. A lot of your competitors are targeting your keyword (its hotly contested) but its the 
only one you can use. If you target it, youll just have to work a bit harder on your 
backlinks in order to rank highly. When theres a lot of competition for a keyword, its 
likely that the traffic payoff is good once you reach top. 
Single Keyword v Keyword Phrases 
Generally speaking, youre better off targeting phrases, not single words. For most businesses, 
theres simply too much competition for single keywords.  
For instance, if youre in computer sales, your normally wouldnt choose computers as your 
keyword. Go to Google and search for computers and youll see why& There are nearly 200 
million results and the top rankings are dominated by the multi-nationals (at the time of 
writing, Apple and Dell). Whats more, research shows that customers are becoming more 
search-savvy  theyre searching for more and more specific strings. Theyre learning that by 
being more specific, they find what theyre looking for much faster.  
So instead of targeting computers, try to think of a more specific keyword phrase. Ask 
yourself whats unique about your business? Perhaps you sell cheap second hand computers? 
Then why not use cheap second hand computers as your keyword phrase? This way, youll 
not only stand a chance in the rankings, youll also display in much more targeted searches. In 
other words, a higher percentage of your sites visitors will be people looking to buy cheap 
second hand computers (as opposed to people after brand new computers, people researching 
the history of the computer, and people trying to figure out how they can use a computer to 
bath their dog!). 
Develop a keyword strategy 
Also, think about developing a keyword strategy. If you start out targeting a very specific 
keyword phrase as described above, make sure it includes the more generic  hotly contested 
 single keyword. For example, youll notice that the keyword phrase above, cheap second 
hand computers includes the single keyword computers. This way, youre really targeting 
both at once. As your sites importance (or PageRank) and search engine presence increases, 
youll start to rank for the single word as well. In time, youll start ranking well for computers 
even though youre only actively targeting cheap second hand computers.  
TIP: Google PageRank (PR) is how Google scores a websites importance. It gives all 
sites a mark out of 10. By downloading the Google Toolbar (from 
http://toolbar.google.com), you can view the PR of any site you visit. 
Chapter Summary 
∑ Find out what words your customers are searching for and make them your keywords.  
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 16

Step 3  Choose your keywords 16 
∑ Use keyword phrases instead of single keywords, but develop a long term keyword 
strategy which will increase your ranking for hotly contested single keywords even as 
you target your specific keyword phrase.

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 17 
Step 4 - Optimize Your Website for Search 
Engines 
Once youve figured out what words your customers are using at the search engines, you need 
to use those words frequently on your site and in the right places  both within your copy and 
within your HTML code (HTML meta tags). This is a big part of what is known as optimizing 
your website for search engines. There are also some site structure  or information 
architecture  and web design considerations (discussed below). 
TIP: When you optimize your website for a particular word, youre essentially telling 
the search engines to include you in the results when people search for that word. 
(How high up the rankings you appear depends largely on the number of links back to 
your site there are.) 
For more information& 
 
∑ on generating backlinks, see Step 5  Generate links back to your site on p.27.  
Optimizing your web copy 
The trick to optimizing your copy is using the most important keywords frequently and in the 
right places without compromising the readability of your copy. But how do you define 
frequently? And what are the right places? What if you want to target a few different 
keywords? And for that matter, what should the wordcount of my pages be? Below are a few 
tips which will help you out. 
What should the wordcount of my pages be? 
Youll hear a lot about the importance of a lot of content. While I definitely agree that content 
is king, there is no need to write volumes. You can reach the top of the search engines with a 
page wordcount of between 100-1000. Below 100 is probably too little for the search engines. 
Above 1000 is definitely too much for your visitors. Certainly dont be intimidated into writing 
pages and pages of copy for your home page (or any other page where short, succinct copy is 
required). 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 18

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 18 
How many times should I use a keyword? 
You dont want to fill every page up with every keyword youre targeting. This simply dilutes 
your sites relevance and reduces readability. Search engines and visitors alike will object; the 
search engines will see your site as spam, and visitors to your site will find it hard to read (if 
not meaningless).  
A good rule of thumb is to aim for a site-wide average keyword density of around 2% 
(measured using LiveKeywordAnalysis - http://www.live-keyword-analysis.com). Density is a 
measure of frequency in relation to the total wordcount of the page. So if your page has 200 
words, and your keyword phrase appears 10 times, its density is 5%. 
When you actually try to do this, youll see that 2% isnt easy to achieve. The easiest way to 
do it is to be specific. As you write every sentence, ask yourself, Could I be more specific?  
For example, dont just say our computers or our products; ask yourself if you can get 
away with saying our cheap second hand computers. Similarly, dont say things like with our 
help; instead, say with the help of our cheap second hand computers. Once you get the 
hang of it, youll find there are more than enough opportunities to replace a generic term with 
your keyword phrase. 
Obviously, theres a bit of an art to it. Sometimes it ends up just sounding like youre 
repeating your keyword phrase over and over again. If this happens, you may just need to 
restructure the sentence or paragraph. Remember, your site reflects the quality of your 
product or service. If your site is hard to read, people will infer a lot about your offering& 
Readability is all-important to visitors. And after all, its the visitors who buy your product or 
service, not the search engines. 
NOTE: You dont need to be paranoid about density. You can have some pages which have a 
high density, and some which have a low density. 
What if I want to target more than one keyword? 
Its best to only target one keyword per page. If you try to target more, your keywords will be 
competing against each other, diluting each others impact. If you need to target more than 
one keyword, simply create a page for each.  
For example, divide your Second Hand Computers site into separate pages for Macs and PCs, 
and then segment again into Notebooks, Desktops, etc. This way, youll be able to incorporate 
very specific keyword phrases into your copy (e.g. For your Macs page, focus on cheap 
second hand macs. For the PCs page, focus on cheap second hand pcs, etc.) 
(See Link paths on p.22 for information on using text links between these pages.) 
Where should I use my keywords? 
When assessing what your website is about, search engines pay close attention to the words 
you use in your text links and headings. So make sure your links and headings are keyword 
rich.

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 19 
Using keywords in links 
When you link from one page to another, try to use your target keyword as the link text (the 
part thats normally blue and underlined). For example, on your Cheap Second Hand Macs 
page, you could include a text link to Cheap Second Hand PCs. 
IMPORTANT: Search engines and humans like different things when it comes to links. 
Search engines like to see your keywords used toward the top of the page. So if youre 
using keywords in your links, it makes sense that you put the links at the top of the page. 
Unfortunately, humans tend to find this distracting. And because they start clicking on links 
before theyve finished reading the whole page, they become easily lost and dont grasp 
the intended message. In most cases, visitors prefer a text link at the bottom of the page.  
But there is a solution; if you have links within the main body of your copy, simply make 
them unmarked (i.e. remove the blue font colour and the underlining). To do this, include 
the following in your CSS file: 
<style type="text/css"> 
<!-- 
a {text-decoration: none;} 
--> 
</style> 
Then format the HTML of each link as follows: 
As well as providing cheap second hand Macs, we sell high quality <a href="pcs.htm" 
style="text-decoration:none"><font color="#000000">cheap second hand pcs</font></a>. 
Using keywords in headings 
Just as customers rely on headings to scan your site, so to do search engines. This means 
headings play a big part in how the search engines will index your site. Try to include your 
keyword phrase in your headings. In fact, think about inserting extra headings just for this 
purpose. Generally this will also help the readability of the site because it will help customers 
scan read. 
For example, if you have a page detailing the benefits of cheap second hand computers, you 
could break it up into logical sections with the following headings. 
The cost benefits of cheap our second hand computers 
The technical benefits of our cheap second hand computers

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 20 
The support benefits of our cheap second hand computers 
Using keywords at the start of the page 
Many SEO experts believe that the search engines see words at the start of a page as more 
representative of what your site is about than words at the end (i.e. prominence). So its a 
good idea to make sure you use your keywords toward the start of each page.  
Optimizing your HTML code 
Within the HTML code behind your page, there are things call meta tags. These are short 
notes within the header of the code which describe some aspects of your page to the search 
engines. Although there is some debate over how important meta tags are when it comes to 
SEO, its generally agreed that they shouldnt be ignored.  
Whether youre building your website yourself, or youre getting a web designer to do it, its a 
good idea to understand the basics. There are four main meta tags you need to consider: 
Tag name How it should look in the code Explanation 
Title <title>Cheap second hand The title is the most important of the 
computers - Widget meta tags. Try to use your keyword at 
least once in the title.  
Computers</title> 
Also, its not just important for your 
ranking; it also has the biggest impact 
on your Click Thru Rate (CTR). The text 
you put in the title will appear as the link 
text in your Google listing  the bit that 
people will read first and click on. Think 
of it as an ad headline  the better it is, 
the more people will click on it. 
TIP: Google only displays 66 
characters in the clickable part 
of your listing. So try to keep 
your Title text to a max of 66 
characters.

--------------------------------------- 21

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 21 
Tag name How it should look in the code Explanation 
Keywords <meta name="KEYWORDS" Search engines used to look only at this 
tag to identify a sites subject material. 
CONTENT="cheap second hand This is no longer the case, but they still 
computers" /> 
pay some attention. 
Description <meta name="DESCRIPTION" The search engines pay some attention 
to this text when identifying your sites 
CONTENT="Cheap second hand 
subject material, so make sure you 
computers for sale - keeping include your keyword at least once in the 
your business running Description. 
efficiently without breaking 
Also, most search engines use this text 
the bank." /> as their description of your site (i.e. its 
the site snapshot that follows your link in 
the search results). Make sure its 
informative and compelling. Think of it 
as the copy for an ad. 
TIP: Google only displays about 
160 characters including spaces. 
So keep your Description text to 
a max of 160 characters. 
Alt <img src="filename.gif" The Alt tag is designed to help visually 
alt="Cheap second hand impaired people use the World Wide Web 
(WWW). They use software to read out 
computer in use" 
loud the content of your website. When 
title="Cheap second hand the software encounters a picture, it 
computer in use"> looks for the Alt text to learn what the 
picture is, then reads that text out loud. 
The Alt tag is relatively important to 
search engines because they assume 
that your pictures have something to do 
with the subject material of your site. 
But like the visual aid software, they 
cant actually see the picture, so they 
look at the Alt text as well. Try to include 
your keyword at least once in your Alt 
text. 
You can use the same meta tags on each page, or you can make them unique. It all depends 
on how many keywords youre targeting. If youre targeting a different keyword in the copy of 
each page, your meta tags for each page will be unique (i.e. youll target that pages keyword 
within these meta tags). 
TIP: If you have any high ranking competitors, take a look at the way theyve done 
their meta tags, and follow their lead. You already know they rank highly, so chances 
are theyve done a good job.

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 22 
Optimizing your site structure 
When structuring the information on your website, there are two main aspects you need to 
consider: 
∑ Multiple keywords 
∑ Link paths 
∑ Site map  
Multiple keywords 
Its good practice to structure your site around the keywords you want to target (i.e. create a 
separate page for each keyword). 
For more information& 
 
∑ on structuring pages around keywords, see What if I want to target more than one 
keyword? on p.18.  
Link paths 
For search engine spiders, text links are like doorways from page to page and site to site. This 
means websites are generally better indexed by search engines if their spiders can traverse 
the entire site using text links. If your site is simple, you can simply link each page to every 
other page using text links at the bottom of the page. But if your site is complex, this is 
impractical. Instead, youll need to create a hierarchical structure and link top to bottom and 
left to right using text links (assuming this doesnt detract from the usability of your site). 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 23

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 23 
 
Figure 1 Text Link Path Hierarchy 
NOTE: In addition to being kind to search engine spiders, this approach allows you to target 
one keyword phrase per page. 
Site map 
You should also use a site map to link all of your pages together. A site map is a single page 
which contains a list of text links to every page in the site (and every page contains a text link 
back to the site map). Think of your site map as being at the center of a spider-web. 
TIP: Site maps are used by both search engine spiders and human visitors, so 
remember to make it user-friendly. Try using bolding and indenting to represent your 
site hierarchy. See http://www.divinewrite.com/site.htm for an example. 
Optimizing your web construction 
Search engine spiders and robots dont see websites the way you and I do. They require your 
site to be designed a particular way. If you dont observe a few rules of thumb, you can 
severely hamper your search engine presence.  
Following is a list of the main things you need to be aware of. There are quite a few more, but 
these are the most important ones. This list will be most useful if your web designer hasnt had 
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 24

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 24 
a lot of experience with SEO. If you engage an experienced SEO web designer, theyll already 
know all the issues (far more than are listed here). 
Dos& 
∑ Design your site in HTML  i.e. HTML based copy and headings and text based links at 
the base of each page as per existing site  
∑ Use static URLs  
∑ Use standard rollovers and/or CSS formatting for navigation menu 
∑ Create a robots.txt file. This file is used to inform the search engine spider which 
pages on a site should not be indexed (check out 
http://www.123promotion.co.uk/tools/robotstxtgenerator.php for an automated one).  
∑ Alternatively, you can do a similar thing by placing tags in the header section of your 
HTML for search engine robots/spiders to read. These tags are as follows: 
o <meta name="ROBOTS" CONTENT="ALL" /> tells the spiders to crawl and 
index your entire site 
o <meta name="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NONE" /> tells the spiders not to index 
anything.  
o <meta name="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX,FOLLOW" /> says dont index this 
particular page, but follow its links to other pages (e.g. for use on secure or 
private pages).  
o <meta name="ROBOTS" CONTENT="INDEX,NOFOLLOW" /> says to index the 
page but not follow its links. 
∑ Create a 404 error handling page, and place a sitemap on the 404 page. 
∑ Use absolute links (not relative links). 
Donts& 
∑ Dont embed your copy within a graphic  
∑ Dont use frames 
∑ Dont use internal JavaScript or Flash  
∑ Dont use "&id=" as a parameter if you want maximal Googlebot crawlage (many sites 
use "&id=" with session IDs that Googlebot usually avoids urls with that parameter)

--------------------------------------- 25

Step 4  Optimize Your Website for Search Engines 25 
Redesigning an existing site 
If youre redesigning an existing site, make sure you pay close attention to your file structure. 
If you move one of your pages from one directory to another, its address will change.  
E.g. If you move your Cheap Second Hand Macs page (CheapSecondHandMacs.htm) from 
&Pages\Products to &\Pages\Products\Macs, its address will change from 
http://www.MadeUpWidgetComputers.com/pages/products/CheapSecondHandMacs.htm to 
http://www.MadeUpWidgetComputers.com/pages/products/Macs/CheapSecondHandMacs.htm. 
This change will mean that any links to the page from other websites will no longer work. It is 
vital that you do not let this happen. Remember, backlinks are the key to a high ranking.  
There are two solutions to this problem: i) Dont change your directory structure; or ii) If you 
DO change your directory structure, make sure you do 301 redirects from the old pages to the 
new ones. (Your web designer will know what youre talking about when you instruct them to 
use 301 redirects.) 
Also, if your site already has a decent ranking (or youve worked hard on your meta tags and 
youre happy with them), make sure your web designer doesnt change your meta tags.  
Paying an SEO company to optimize your site 
If you decide to pay an SEO company to optimize your site for you, always ask them exactly 
what they will be doing. Ask them what keywords they will be targeting, and how will target 
them. There are no secret methods, so if they can't or won't tell you, DO NOT engage them. 
There are also some companies which will make grand claims about top 10 rankings in a week, 
but don't specify which keywords you will rank highly for. Instead of ranking highly for the 
words that your customers are searching for, you end up ranking highly for extremely obscure, 
meaningless keyword phrases like, "red brochure book printing in Jamaica". 
Also, always be clear in your own mind on exactly what you're paying for. Remember that 
there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking: optimizing your site, and generating links back 
to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which part(s) they will do for 
you, and how they plan to do it. 
Chapter Summary 
∑ Use your keyword frequently, but not too frequently. Go for a site-wide average 
keyword density of around 2%. 
∑ Only target one keyword per page (unless there is very little competition for your 
keywords). 
∑ If you need to target more than one keyword, create a new page for each. 
∑ Use keywords in links and headings.

∑ Create a text based site map which links to every page (and which every page links 
to) via text links. 
∑ If your web designer is not an SEO expert, make sure you provide them with some 
optimization rules.

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 27 
Step 5 - Generate links back to your site 
Links are the single most important aspect of SEO. Generally speaking, the more links you 
have back to your site, the higher your ranking will be. 
Of course, nothing is ever that simple. There are links, and there are links. Before launching 
into a discussion about the best ways to generate links, lets first discuss what kind of links 
you should be trying to generate. 
When deciding whether to display your site in its search results, a search engine looks to see if 
youre part of a credible network of related sites. This means that the ideal kind of links are 
those that: 
∑ come from relevant sites (sites which use the same keywords); 
∑ come from important sites (have a high ranking); 
∑ include your keyword as part of the visible link text; 
∑ include varying link text (not the same link text each time); and 
∑ come from a page that links to few other sites. 
When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions, it says, Hey, 
this site must be credible and important, because others in the same industry are pointing to 
it.  
How do I generate lots of ideal links? 
There are many possible ways to generate links. Some are dubious (like auto-generation 
software, and sites set up by webmasters simply to host links to their other sites) and I wont 
be discussing them here. Others, like those discussed below, are legitimate.  
NOTE: Link generation is an ongoing (often tedious) task. You need to be dedicated and 
systematic. In other words, you need a strategy. Take a look through the link generation 
alternatives discussed below to see what suits you best. Then put your thinking cap on and get

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 28 
creative. Its a new and very exciting field; there are undoubtedly many undiscovered ways to 
generate links. This chapter is just a starting point. 
Add your site to DMOZ & Yahoo Directories 
The first thing you should do is add a link in the following two directories: 
∑ DMOZ Open Directory Project (http://www.dmoz.com/add.html)  &the largest, 
most comprehensive human-edited directory of the Web. It is constructed and 
maintained by a vast, global community of volunteer editors. DMOZ does not charge 
for submissions. NOTE: This is the same as the Google Directory. 
∑ Yahoo Directory (https://ecom.yahoo.com/dir/submit/intro/)  Yahoo charges for 
submissions (at the time of writing, the submission fee was USD$299). 
The search engines regularly crawl these directories in search of new links, and they value 
these links quite highly (largely because the directories are human-edited). 
Check where your competitors links are coming from 
Next, check who is linking to your high ranking competitors. This method takes a long time, 
but youll be surprised where some of their links come from. To check on the links of your 
competitors: 
STEP 1) Go to Google and search for your keyword.  
STEP 2) Make a note of the top 5 competitors who appear (write down their 
domain name). 
STEP 3) Return to Google and search for the first domain name in the list (i.e. 
type www.competitorsdomainname.com in the search field). 
STEP 4) Google will then display a screen which says, Google can show you the 
following information for this URL: At the bottom of the list of option is 
Find web pages that contain the term 
"www.competitorsdomainname.com"". Click on this option. 
STEP 5) Google will display all the pages it can find that link to your competitors 
website. (TIP: If there are many results, bookmark the search results 
page as this process will take a long time  possibly months.) 
STEP 6) Visit each page (TIP: Right click on the first result and select Open in 
New Window. By opening a separate window to see the page, you wont 
lose your search results page.) 
STEP 7) Try think of a way to get a link to your website on the same page (TIP: 
Avoid sending them an email as webmaster receive a lot of SPAM and 
your email will likely go unnoticed. Try calling them instead.)

--------------------------------------- 29

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 29 
STEP 8) Repeat for each of your top 5 ranking competitors. 
TIP: In the list of results, the sites which appear high up in the list of results are 
likely to have a higher Google PageRank (PR  see Glossary) than the sites which 
appear toward the end of the list. You should be more interested in obtaining links to 
sites with a high PR (assuming theyre also relevant). 
Article PR - Write and submit articles for Internet publication 
Next, write articles and do some article PR! Ive always found this to be the best way to 
generate inbound links. Write helpful articles and let publishers of newsletters and ezines use 
them for free  on the proviso that they link back to your site.  
People who publish ezines and newsletters are always hungry for quality content. And there 
are many websites out there dedicated to giving them just that. If you submit a well written, 
relevant, helpful article to one of those sites, you can have thousands of newsletter publishers 
ready to snap it up. Then you just sit back and watch the links multiply! 
TIP: The article PR method is beneficial in other ways too. Readers of your article will 
see that you know what youre talking about, and because youre published, theyll 
see you as an authority. Youll find web traffic and requests for quotes increase after 
every article. 
Heres how article PR works& 
STEP 1) Youre an expert in your field so you possess knowledge that other people 
want.  
STEP 2) You write a helpful article  sharing your hard-earned knowledge and 
expertise (without compromising your income stream). 
STEP 3) You submit your article to recognized and highly trafficked Article 
Submit sites on the World Wide Web. 
STEP 4) Publishers of online newsletters, ezines, etc. gather content from these 
sites for free. 
STEP 5) Helpful, well written articles are snapped up by thousands of publishers 
from all around the world in virtually every industry. 
STEP 6) The only condition is that they must publish the article with a functioning 
link to your site. 
STEP 7) If 300 people publish your article, you get 300 links back to your site. 
And the best part is that every link is relevant (and you even get to 
choose the link text!)

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 30 
Article PR FAQs 
Below are some FAQs that will help you write your articles and manage your article PR 
campaign.  
Q) What should I write about? 
A) Write about what you know. Make sure its related to your business (so you can use the 
keywords you want to rank for) and helpful (so it gets published). For example, if youre a 
manufacturer of industrial plastics, you might write an article - or series of articles - on how 
best to handle Teflon tubing prior to installation. Once you get thinking about it, you'll 
probably find there are hundreds of articles you could write that are helpful. You may even 
have some of them partly written already in your instruction manuals or installation guides, 
etc. Another good idea is to think of all the questions you get asked by customers and 
potential customers. These questions show you what people are interested in. If you write an 
article answering every one of these questions, you'll get published, and you'll also show 
yourself to be a credible expert. (You may even cut down phone support time!) 
Q) How long should my article be? 
A) The best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet  theres 
nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token, if you need 1500 words to say all 
you need to say, thats fine as well (but Id still be thinking about how to break that into three 
parts and get three times as many links!). 
Q) How often to submit? 
A) Whenever you write an article. 
Q) What kind of writing should I use? 
A) Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old 
school, dont write like I am. Dont use contractions, dont end sentences with prepositions, 
and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school, just use 
conversational English. In fact, the more of yourself you include in the article, the more 
engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. 
Q) Should I focus on keywords? 
A) Yes! Yes! Yes! Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website. (In fact, as youll 
probably post the articles on your website, youre really are writing for your website, anyway.) 
If possible, turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include 
keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as 
Spam; if your article provides good quality information and guidance, it won't be seen as spam 
by the search engines even when its keyword-rich. 
Q) Do I need to vary the byline? 
A) There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links 
back to your site (otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated - i.e. SPAM). 
Therefore, its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline (without 
departing from your keywords).  
SEO Secrets V1.3  © Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 



--------------------------------------- 31

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 31 
Q) Should I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to 
other pages? 
A) Link back to whatever page matches the keywords used in your article. If your website only 
targets one keyword, simply link back to your home page. 
Q) Where should I submit my article? 
A) There are hundreds, if not thousands, of article submission sites and article distribution lists 
on the World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just 
find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. 
Q) How long does it take to submit a single article? 
A) It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full day to submit a single 
article to the 50+ submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while, so Im 
fairly fast at it, but its not a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times, youll have it 
down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently when you do it. 
Q) Who will publish my article?  
A) Generally people publish pre-written articles because they want eyes on paper. In other 
words, they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that 
because theyre keyword-rich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert, 
helpful articles also make the publisher seem like a credible authority on a particular subject. 
And, of course, they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands (maybe even 
millions) of companies publishing online newsletters, ezines, and article pages. No matter what 
your industry, youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In 
fact, once a few publishers recognize you as a good source of content, they keep coming back 
looking for more (and even email you asking if you can send them directly). 
Q) How will I know when my article has been published? 
A) As one of the conditions of publication, you can request that the publisher notifies you when 
they use your article. Of course, most dont bother to do this, so it's a good idea to set up a 
Google Alert (http://www.google.com/alerts) which notifies you when your URL has been 
published on a web page. Google doesn't pick them all up, but it picks up a lot. Whenever you 
receive an alert, you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back 
to your site is functioning. 
Q) How much cross-publication of a single article is acceptable? 
A) It doesn't matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites 
(probably hundreds). These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. 
Q) Will the publisher change my article? 
A) No, generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact, thats why publishers like 
good articles and consistent content providers  because that means they dont have to do any 
extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times, and dont recall a single 
instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it, you can 
include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication.

--------------------------------------- 32

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 32 
Q) Should I post my article on my website? 
A) Yes! Articles are solid, keyword-rich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. 
Add a new page for every article, and link to each from a top level articles page (see 
http://www.divinewrite.com/articles.htm for a working example).  
Q) Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR? 
A) Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a 
number of high traffic article submission sites. 
Q) What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my 
article? 
A) Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like, "We want to write an article which 
helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people who'd be doing it are... They'd be doing 
it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties they'd face are... Here are the key 
steps to successful installation..."  Using this information, your SEO copywriter should be able 
to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. 
Q) Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site? 
A) It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is 
unrelated, the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article and/or your target 
market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic, very few people will see your article 
there anyway. And besides, even if your article appears on a dubious site, it probably wont be 
changed because  dubious or not  publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So 
your original presentation, content, and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article, and it 
always reflects well on you, no matter where it's published. 
Q) How long will it take for my ranking to increase? 
A) There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start, the search engines can take 
up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have 
much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords, and where the 
links are coming from, 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. (Links from high 
PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too 
quickly. But if youre dedicated, and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles, 
youll definitely see results within a few months. 
Submit your site to local and industry directories 
Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local 
directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as 
directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good (such 
as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28.), but most are of questionable value. There are 
several reasons for this: 
1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website (and 
remember, ideal links come from related websites). 
2. Many directories will charge you for a listing (its only worth paying if the website 
is related and has a high PR).

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 33 
3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of 
links to other sites. As mentioned above, its best if your link appears on a page with 
few (if any) links to other pages. 
4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money; they either 
charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space (or both). They can be a 
great income source for their owners, and this makes them a very inviting business 
idea. As a result, thousands of new directories are popping up every year, and very 
few of them are any good.  
Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant and/or have a high ranking or PR. Also keep 
your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic (e.g. local business 
directories). But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent 
writing and submitting articles. 
TIP: If you really feel the need to add your site to directories, take a look at 
http://www.webproworld.com/viewtopic.php?t=21900&sid=aea99f48670ee336f2b922
c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that 
accept links. 
Look for link partners 
Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is 
done in a variety of ways: 
∑ ask customers to link to your site (possibly in return for a link to theirs) 
∑ ask suppliers to link to your site (possibly in return for a link to theirs) 
∑ look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you (possibly in return for 
a link to theirs) 
∑ buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their 
owners asking them to link to you (possibly in return for a link to theirs) 
Interestingly, looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your 
search engine ranking because: 
1. Its normally done via email and, unfortunately, webmasters of high ranking sites 
receive many link partner requests each day (not to mention hundreds of other 
SPAM emails). Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result, most email-
initiated link partner requests are deleted. 
2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of 
high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site, it 
wouldnt help the high PR site at all (and may in fact hinder their ranking).

--------------------------------------- 34

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 34 
3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link (a link back to their website), most webmasters of 
high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more, they wont 
want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links (relevant or not, 
they dont want to look like a directory to their customers). 
TIP: If you decide to manually look for link partners, one way of assessing a sites 
importance is to look at their Google PageRank (PR). PR is how Google scores 
importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is 
generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar (from 
http://toolbar.google.com), you can view the PR of any site you visit. 
How long will it take? 
A long time! 
Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links, but you can be 
sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep 
at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then, youll still need to dedicate some 
ongoing time to the task, otherwise your ranking will drop. 
Is it possible to generate links too fast? 
Yes, its possible. But using the methods outlined above, its extremely unlikely. 
The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance, if you had 100 links 
to your site yesterday, but you have 2100 today, the search engines will assume youve done 
something a little shady, and sandbox your links (i.e. delay their full impact) until it 
establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. 
Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of 
links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly, but it might also see 
you blacklisted! 
Paying an SEO company to generate links for you 
Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of 
promotion, it requires investment - either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the 
task of generating links, be careful. There are some companies which generate links to a 
domain of their own, and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in 
a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee, and 
so long as you pay the fee, your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee 
(e.g. you find another SEO company that you prefer), your site's ranking will drop back to 
where it was when you started out. Effectively, they hold you to ransom.

--------------------------------------- 35

Step 5  Generate links back to your site 35 
Don't get caught out! When you're researching SEO companies to generate links for you, 
ALWAYS ask them how they will do it. If they can't or won't tell you, DO NOT engage them. If 
they tell you but you are unable to completely understand, DO NOT engage them (there are no 
link generation methods which are too complex for the layperson to understand when 
explained properly). 
Also, always be clear in your own mind on exactly what you're paying for. Remember that 
there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking: optimizing your site, and generating links back 
to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which part(s) they will do for 
you, and how they plan to do it. 
Chapter Summary 
∑ Generally speaking, the more links you have back to your site, the higher your 
ranking will be. 
∑ Some links are better than others. 
∑ Dont use auto-link-generation software 
∑ Dont set up websites simply to host links to your main site 
∑ Add your site to DMOZ & Yahoo Directories 
∑ Check where your competitors links are coming from 
∑ Write and submit articles for Internet publication 
∑ Submit your site to local and industry directories 
∑ Look for link partners (but dont spend too much time on it) 
∑ Link generation takes a long time no matter how you do it!

Step 6  Monitor your progress 36 
Step 6 - Monitor your progress 
Now that youve done the lions share of the hard work, you can sit back and observe the 
results of your handiwork. Its very important that you monitor your progress. Keep an eye on 
how many links youre generating, where theyre coming from, and the overall impact on your 
ranking. 
Monitor how many links youíre generating 
Its important to monitor how many links youre generating because you can cross-reference 
that information against improvements in ranking to estimate how much effort your SEO push 
is going to take. e.g. If you generate 300 links and your site goes from number 150 to number 
15, you know that you should be topping the rankings before too long. If, on the other hand, 
your ranking has only marginally increased, you know you need to work a lot harder. 
You can monitor how many links youre generating in a number of ways: 
∑ Search Google for www.yourdomainname.com. Google will then display a screen 
which says, Google can show you the following information for this URL: At the 
bottom of the list of option is Find web pages that contain the term 
"www.yourdomainname.com"". Click on this option. Google will display all the pages it 
can find that have www.yourdomainname.com on one of their pages. Normally this 
indicates a link to your site. (TIP: Bookmark the search results page so you can 
perform this search quickly and easily as you will probably find yourself doing it quite 
often.) 
∑ Go to http://www.marketleap.com/publinkpop/ and type in your domain name. This 
tool itemizes your links by search engine (i.e. tells you how many links each search 
engine has found) and also provides graphical trends. 
∑ Go to http://www.alexa.com and type in your domain name, then click Sites Linking 
in from the left of the page. (TIP: Alexa can also be used to track your ranking 
metrics.)

--------------------------------------- 37

Step 6  Monitor your progress 37 
TIP: Youll notice that each of these tools return different figures. Dont worry about 
this. Just pick a tool and stick with it  this way youre always comparing apples with 
apples. 
Monitor whoís linking to your site 
Always keep track of whos linking to your site. Apart from simply being interesting, it will give 
you some idea of who is interested in your site and your material, you can assess their 
importance (PR), and also more accurately target their needs with future link generation 
tactics. 
Probably the easiest way to track whos linking to your site is to set up a Google Monitor at 
http://www.google.com/alerts. Google alerts notify you when your URL has been published on 
a web page. Google doesn't pick them all up, but it picks up a lot.  
TIP: Whenever you receive an alert, you can visit the page to make sure the article in 
unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. 
Monitor your ranking 
Obviously you should be monitoring your ranking to ensure that your hard work is not wasted 
(and to adapt your SEO and link generation strategy as needed). 
Manually 
You can check your ranking manually simply by doing a search for your keyword at the 
appropriate search engine. 
TIP: If you prefer to check manually, make sure you bookmark the search results 
page as youll probably find yourself performing this search fairly frequently. Dont 
perform it too frequently, though, as this can impact the perceived desirability of your 
keywords (and it is argued that Google takes exception to repeated searches of this 
type). 
Automatically 
You can check all the major search engines (AOL, Google, HotBot, MSN, Netscape, 
Yahoo/Fast/AltaVista) at once using MarketLeaps verification tool 
http://www.marketleap.com/verify/default.htm. NOTE: This tool returns a page number (e.g. 
it will tell you your site appears on page 2 of Yahoo).  
There are plenty of other tools out there that you can use to monitor your ranking, such as 
CleverStats Free Monitor for Google (see http://www.cleverstat.com/google-monitor-
query.htm). Shop around until you find the tool that suits you best. The important thing to

Step 6  Monitor your progress 38 
remember is that you dont have to pay anything for a rank monitoring tool as there are plenty 
of free ones on offer. 
Chapter Summary 
∑ Monitor how many links you have and cross-reference that information against 
improvements in ranking to estimate how much effort your SEO push is going to take.  
∑ Monitor who is linking to your site to more accurately adapt future link generation 
tactics. 
∑ Monitor your ranking and adapt your SEO and link generation strategy as needed.

Conclusion 39 
Conclusion 
Search Engine Optimization is not a black art; its a science. There are defined rules and 
proven methodologies. And although theres a lot more to it than can be contained in a book of 
this size, you shouldnt need any more than what youve just read to obtain a high ranking in 
the search engines. 
But theres no denying that its hard work and takes a long time. Whatever you do, dont rush 
into it. Make sure you understand the fundamentals, then take some time to plan your 
approach.  
In other words, SEO strategy must be part of your marketing plan alongside traditional 
promotional activities such as print, radio, and TV. Just as importantly, it must be part of your 
marketing budget. Dont fall into the trap of thinking that the search engines are free 
advertising. Theyre not! Companies like Google and Yahoo may not accept payment for a high 
ranking, but that doesnt mean it comes for free. Someone has to do the work to get you 
there. Whether you spend the time to do it yourself, or you engage an expert to do it for you, 
SEO requires a serious investment.  
But the spoils are well worth it. Research suggests that being number 1 in Google means twice 
as much traffic as being number 2. Imagine how much difference it would make to your web 
traffic&

Frequently Asked Questions 40 
Frequently Asked Questions 
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a foreign field to a lot of people. Rarely does a day go by 
when I don't get asked a few questions on the subject. So I've decided to post this FAQ article 
in the hopes that it will help people understand the basics, and make them a little more 
comfortable with the whole domain. 
Q: Why are search engines important to me?  
A: 85% of all website traffic is driven by search engines. The only online activity more popular 
than search is email. 79.2% of US users don't go to page 2 of search results. 42% of users 
click on the no.1 result. For the under-40 age-group, the Internet will become the most used 
media in the next 2-3 years.  
Q: How do search engines decide on their rankings?  
A: IMPORTANT: You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural 
results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search 
engines.  
Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or 
robots which crawl (analyze) your site and index (record) its details. Complex algorithms 
are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the 
search engines search results.  
Q: Can't I just pay for a high ranking?  
A: No. The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding 
content that will bring them more traffic (and thus more advertising revenue). In other words, 
their results must be relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine; irrelevant 
results makes for a short-lived search engine.  
Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search:  
 Natural/Organic  The real search results. The results that most users are looking 
for and which take up most of the window. For most searches, the search engine 
displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you 
searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they 
are.

--------------------------------------- 41

Frequently Asked Questions 41 
 Paid  Pure advertising. This is how the search engines make their money. 
Advertisers pay the search engines to display their ad whenever someone searches 
for a word which is related to their product or service. These ads look similar to the 
natural search results, but are normally labeled Sponsored Links, and normally take 
up a smaller portion of the window.  
Q: How do I get a high ranking?  
A: There are four main steps:  
Step 1 - Use the right words on your website 
Step 2 - Get lots of relevant sites to link to yours 
Step 3 - Use the right words in those links 
Step 4 - Have lots of content on your site & add more regularly 
Q: What is search engine optimization (SEO)?  
A: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the art of creating a website which is search engine-
friendly. This means:  
 using the right words in your copy  
 using the right words in your HTML code  
 structuring your site properly  
 designing your site properly 
For more information on these 4 elements, download our free 'SEO Secrets' eBook from 
http://www.divinewrite.com/seosecrets.htm .  
Many people use SEO to also describe the other ingredient in a high ranking, 'Link Popularity'.  
Q: What is link popularity?  
A: Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. 
The links to your website are votes. The more votes (links) a candidate (website) has, the 
more important it is, and the higher its ranking. Link popularity is all about how many links 
you have, and how you can get more.  
Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is. They assume that if its 
important enough for a lot of other sites to link to, its important enough for them to display at 
the top of the rankings. Links are the single most important factor in ranking. Generally 
speaking, the more links you have to your site from other sites, the better your ranking.

Frequently Asked Questions 42 
Q: How many links to my site are there?  
A: Search Google for "www.yourdomain.com". (Don't search for "link:www.yourdomain.com" 
as this only returns a subset of the links to your site.) Then on the page that displays next, 
select "Find web pages that contain the term "www.yourdomain.com" ". When you do it this 
way, you'll see all the pages that contain your URL. In most cases, the URL will be an active 
link (or at least it should be... if it's not, you should ask the site owner to make it so). There 
are also some tools you can use 
For more information& 
 
∑ on tools, p.43.  
Q: Are some links better than others?  
A: Yes! The ideal kind of links are those that:  
 come from relevant sites (sites which use the same keywords);  
 come from important sites (have a high ranking);  
 include your keyword as part of the visible link text;  
 include varying link text (not the same link text each time); and  
 come from a page that links to few other sites.  
When a search engine sees a link which satisfies most or all of these conditions, it says, Hey, 
this site must be credible and important, because others in the same industry are pointing to 
it.  
Q: How do I get lots of links back to my site?  
A: There are many possible ways to generate links. Some are dubious (like auto-generation 
software, and sites set up by webmasters simply to host links to their other sites) and I wont 
be discussing them here. Others, like those discussed below, are legitimate. 
 Add your site to DMOZ & Yahoo Directories (and other free directories)  
 Check where your competitors links are coming from  
 Article PR - Write and submit articles for Internet publication  
 Swap links  
 Partner websites  
 Pay for links 
For more information on these methods, download our free 'SEO Secrets' eBook from 
http://www.divinewrite.com/seosecrets.htm .  
Q: What do you think is the best way to get lots of links?  
A: Article PR. Write helpful articles and let other webmasters publish them for free in exchange 
for a link in the byline. With article PR, you don't have to pay for the link, you determine the 
content of the page containing the link, you determine the link text, and the link is more or 
less permanent. A single article can be reprinted hundreds of times, and each time is another 
link back to your site!

Q: How do I write a good article PR piece?  
A: See http://www.divinewrite.com/seoarticles.htm . 
Q: How do I get a high ranking using free reprint content?  
A: See http://www.divinewrite.com/Top_Ranking_Free.htm . 
Q: How long does it take to get a high search engine ranking?  
A: A long time! Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links, but 
you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just 
have to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then, youll still need to 
dedicate some ongoing time to the task, otherwise your ranking will drop.  
Q: What is the Google Sandbox, and is it real?  
A: The Google Sandbox theory suggest that whenever Google detects a new website, it 
withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine, 
credible, long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites (sites which 
serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site).  
There is a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting the theory, but there is also a lot discounting it. 
No one has categorically proven its existence.  
Q: What is the Google Dampening Link Filter, and is it real?  
A: The Google Dampening Link Filter theory suggests that if Google detects a sudden increase 
(i.e. many hundreds or thousands) in the number of links back to your site, it may sandbox 
them for a period (or in fact penalize you by lowering your ranking or blacklisting your site 
altogether).  
There is a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting the theory, but there is also a lot discounting it. 
No one has categorically proven its existence.  
Q: What SEO companies should I be wary of?  
A: Be wary of SEO companies that promise or guarantee results in a given timeframe, 
especially if they won't expand on their methods for generating links back to your site.  
Q: What tools can you recommend?  
A: There are many very useful tools to help with your SEO. The following are just selection. All

Q: What is keyword analysis?  
A: The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is 
decide which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword analysis. 
Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the 
benefits you offer your customers.

Q: Do I need to submit my site to the search engines?  
A: Theoretically, no. But I wouldn't risk not doing it - especially as it's free. As soon as you 
register your domain name, submit it to Google! Even if you havent built your site, or thought 
about your content, submit your domain name to Google. In fact, even if you havent fully 
articulated your business plan and marketing plan, submit your domain name to Google.

Q: Should I submit my site to the search engines more than once?  
A: No need. Although some of the search engines allow you to do this, there's really no need.

Frequently Asked Questions 45 
Q: What are directories and should I submit my site to them?  
A: Directories are websites (or web pages) which simply list lots of website and give a quick 
description of the website. Some are free and some require you to pay for a listing. Free 
directories are useful because you get a free link. However, the links aren't worth that much. 
Paid directories can be good if they're relevant, but they can cost a lot in the long term, so 
choose wisely.  
One essential directories for any website is the DMOZ Open Directory Project.

Glossary of Terms 46 
Glossary of Terms 
AdWords 
See Sponsored Links. 
algorithm 
A complex mathematical formula used by search engines to assess the relevance and 
importance of websites and rank them accordingly in their search results. These algorithms are 
kept tightly under wraps as they are the key to the objectivity of search engines (i.e. the 
algorithm ensures relevant results, and relevant results bring more users, which in turn brings 
more advertising revenue). 
article PR 
The submitting of free reprint articles to many article submission sites and article distribution 
lists in order to increase your website's search engine ranking and Google PageRank. (In this 
sense, the "PR" stands for PageRank.) Like traditional public relations, article PR also conveys 
a sense of authority because your articles are widely published. And because you're proving 
your expertise and freely dispensing knowledge, your readers will trust you and will be more 
likely to remain loyal to you. (In this sense, the "PR" stands for Public Relations.) 
article distribution lists 
User groups (e.g. Yahoo, MSN, Google, Smartgroups, and Topica groups) which accept email 
submissions of articles in text format, and then distribute these articles via email to all of the 
members of the group. See also 'article PR'. 
article submission sites 
Websites which act as repositories of free reprint articles. Authors visit these sites to submit 
their articles free of charge, and webmasters visit to find articles to use on their websites free 
of charge. Article submission sites generate revenue by selling advertising space on their 
websites. See also 'article PR'. 
backlink 
A text link to your website from another website. See also link. 
copy 
The words used on your website.

Glossary of Terms 47 
copywriter 
A professional writer who specializes in the writing of advertising copy (compelling, engaging 
words promoting a particular product or service). See also SEO copywriter and web 
copywriter. 
crawl 
Google finds pages on the World Wide Web and records their details in its index by sending out 
spiders or robots. These spiders make their way from page to page and site to site by 
following text links. To a spider, a text link is like a door.  
domain name 
The virtual address of your website (normally in the form www.yourbusinessname.com). This 
is what people will type when they want to visit your site. It is also what you will use as the 
address in any text links back to your site. 
ezine 
An electronic magazine. Most publishers of ezines are desperate for content and gladly publish 
well written, helpful articles and give you full credit as author, including a link to your website. 
Flash 
A technology used to create animated web pages (and page elements). 
free reprint article 
An article written by you and made freely available to other webmasters to publish on their 
websites. See also 'article PR'. 
Google  
The search engine with the greatest coverage of the World Wide Web, and which is responsible 
for most search engine-referred traffic. Of approximately 11.5 billion pages on the World Wide 
Web, it is estimated that Google has indexed around 8.8 billion. This is one reason why it takes 
so long to increase your ranking! 
Google AdWords 
See Sponsored Links. 
Google PageRank 
How Google scores a websites importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. By downloading 
the Google Toolbar (from http://toolbar.google.com), you can view the PR of any site you visit. 
Google Toolbar 
A free tool you can download. It becomes part of your browser toolbar. Its most useful 
features are its PageRank display (which allows you to view the PR of any site you visit) and 
its AutoFill function (when youre filling out an online form, you can click AutoFill, and it enters 
all the standard information automatically, including Name, Address, Zip code/Postcode, Phone 
Number, Email Address, Business Name, Credit Card Number (password protected), etc.) Once 
youve downloaded and installed the toolbar, you may need to set up how youd like it to look 
and work by clicking Options (setup is very easy). NOTE: Google does record some information 
(mostly regarding sites visited).

Glossary of Terms 48 
 
HTML 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the coding language used to create much of the 
information on the World Wide Web. Web browsers read the HTML code and display the page 
that code describes. 
Internet 
An interconnected network of computers around the world. 
JavaScript 
A programming language used to create dynamic website pages (e.g. interactivity). 
keyword 
A word which your customers search for and which you use frequently on your site in order to 
be relevant to those searches. This use known as targeting a keyword. Most websites actually 
target keyword phrases because single keywords are too generic and it is very difficult to 
rank highly for them. 
keyword density 
A measure of the frequency of your keyword in relation to the total wordcount of the page. So 
if your page has 200 words, and your keyword phrase appears 10 times, its density is 5%.  
keyword phrase 
A phrase which your customers search for and which you use frequently on your site in order 
to be relevant to those searches.  
link 
A word or image on a web page which the reader can click to visit another page. There are 
normally visual cues to indicate to the reader that the word or image is a link. 
link path 
Using text links to connect a series of page (i.e. page 1 connects to page 2, page 2 connects to 
page 3, page 3 connects to page 4, and so on). Search engine spiders and robots use text 
links to jump from page to page as they gather information about it, so its a good idea to 
allow them traverse your entire site via text links. (See Link paths on p.22. for further 
information.)  
link partner 
A webmaster who is willing to put a link to your website on their website. Quite often link 
partners engage in reciprocal linking. 
link popularity 
The number of links to your website. Link popularity is the single most important factor in a 
high search engine ranking. Webmasters use a number of methods to increase their site's link 
popularity including article PR, link exchange (link partners / reciprocal linking), link buying, 
and link directories.

--------------------------------------- 49

Glossary of Terms 49 
link text 
The part of a text link that is visible to the reader. When generating links to your own site, 
they are most effective (in terms of ranking) if they include your keyword. 
meta tag 
A short note within the header of the HTML of your web page which describes some aspect of 
that page. These meta tags are read by the search engines and used to help assess the 
relevance of a site to a particular search. 
natural search results 
The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of 
the window. For most searches, the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with 
content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to 
how relevant and important they are.  
organic search results 
See natural search results.  
PPC (Pay-Per-Click advertising) 
See Sponsored Links. 
PageRank 
See Google PageRank. 
rank 
Your position in the search results that display when someone searches for a particular word at 
a search engine.  
reciprocal link 
A mutual agreement between two webmasters to exchange links (i.e. they both add a link to 
the others website on their own website). Most search engines (certainly Google) are 
sophisticated enough to detect reciprocal linking and they dont view it very favorably because 
it is clearly a manufactured method of generating links. Websites with reciprocal links risk 
being penalized. 
robot 
See Spider. 
robots.txt file 
A file which is used to inform the search engine spider which pages on a site should not be 
indexed. This file sits in your sites root directory on the web server. (Alternatively, you can do 
a similar thing by placing tags in the header section of your HTML for search engine 
robots/spiders to read. See Optimizing your web  on p.23. for more information.) 
Sandbox 
Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new 
website, it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a 
genuine, credible, long term site. It does this to discourage the creation of SPAM websites

--------------------------------------- 50

Glossary of Terms 50 
(sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some other site). 
Likewise, if Google detects a sudden increase (i.e. many hundreds or thousands) in the 
number of links back to your site, it may sandbox them for a period (or in fact penalize you by 
lowering your ranking or blacklisting your site altogether). 
SEO 
Search Engine Optimization. The art of making your website relevant and important so that it 
ranks high in the search results for a particular word. 
SEO copywriter 
A copywriter who is not only proficient at web copy, but also experienced in writing copy 
which is optimized for search engines (and will therefore help you achieve a better search 
engine ranking for your website). 
search engine 
A search engine is an online tool which allows you to search for websites which contain a 
particular word or phrase. The most well known search engines are Google, Yahoo, and MSN. 
site map 
A single page which contains a list of text links to every page in the site (and every page 
contains a text link back to the site map). Think of your site map as being at the center of a 
spider-web. 
SPAM 
Generally refers to unwanted and unrequested email sent en-masse to private email 
addresses. Also used to refer to websites which appear high in search results without having 
any useful content. The creators of these sites set them up simply to cash in on their high 
ranking by selling advertising space, links to other sites, or by linking to other sites of their 
own and thereby increasing the ranking of those sites. The search engines are becoming 
increasingly sophisticated, and already have very efficient ways to detect SPAM websites and 
penalize them. 
spider 
Google finds pages on the World Wide Web and records their details in its index by sending out 
spiders or robots. These spiders make their way from page to page and site to site by 
following text links.  
Sponsored Links 
Paid advertising which displays next to the natural search results. Customers can click on the 
ad to visit the advertisers website. This is how the search engines make their money. 
Advertisers set their ads up to display whenever someone searches for a word which is related 
to their product or service. These ads look similar to the natural search results, but are 
normally labeled Sponsored Links, and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. 
These ads work on a Pay-Per-Click (PPC) basis (i.e. the advertiser only pays when someone 
clicks on their ad). 
submit 
You can submit your domain name to the search engines so that their spiders or robots will

--------------------------------------- 51

Glossary of Terms 51 
crawl your site. You can also submit articles to article submission sites in order to have them 
published on the Internet. 
text link 
A word on a web page which the reader can click to visit another page. Text links are normally 
blue and underlined. Text links are what spiders or robots use to jump from page to page 
and website to website. 
URL 
Uniform Resource Locator. The address of a particular page published on the Internet. 
Normally in the form http://www.yourbusinessname.com/AWebPage.htm.  
web copy 
See copy. 
web copywriter 
A copywriter who understands the unique requirements of writing for an online medium. 
webmaster 
A person responsible for the management of a particular website. 
wordcount 
The number of words on a particular web page. 
World Wide Web (WWW) 
The vast array of documents published on the Internet. It is estimated that the World Wide 
Web now consists of approximately 11.5 billion pages.

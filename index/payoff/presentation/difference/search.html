    publish your article you get 300 links back to your site. And the best part is that every link is relevant and you even get to choose the link text SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 30 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 30 Article PR FAQs Below are some FAQs that will help you write your articles and manage your article PR campaign. Q What should I write about A Write about what you know. Make sure its related to your business so you can use the keywords you want to rank for rankmaniac 2012 and helpful so it gets published. For example if youre a manufacturer of industrial plastics you might write an article or series of articles on how best to handle Teflon tubing prior to installation. Once you get thinking <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> about it rankmaniac 2012 youll probably find there are hundreds of articles you rankmaniac 2012 could write that are helpful. You may even have some of them partly written already in your instruction manuals or installation guides etc. Another good idea is to think of all the questions you get asked by customers and potential customers. These questions show you what people rankmaniac 2012 are interested in. If you write rankmaniac 2012 an article answering every one of these rankmaniac 2012 questions youll get published and youll also show yourself to be a credible expert. You may even cut down phone support time Q How long should my article be A The best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> word article. By the same token if you need 1500 words to say all you need to say thats fine as well but Id still be thinking about how to break that into three parts and get three times as many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. rankmaniac 2012 Dont use contractions dont end rankmaniac 2012 sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the rankmaniac 2012 headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as rankmaniac 2012 Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it wont rankmaniac 2012 be seen as spam by the search engines even when its keywordrich. Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text rankmaniac 2012 in links back to your rankmaniac 2012 site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM. Therefore its probably a good idea to vary at least the link text of your byline without departing from your keywords. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 31 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 31 Q Should I always use the byline to link to my home page or should I also link to other pages A Link back to whatever page matches the keywords <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> used in your article. If your website only targets one keyword simply link back to your home page. Q Where should I submit my article A There are hundreds if not thousands of article submission sites and article distribution lists on the World Wide Web. Too many to include here. Do a search for article submit and just find the ones that are most applicable to your industry and offer the most subscribers. Q How long does it rankmaniac 2012 take to submit a single article A It all depends on how many sites you submit it to. I allow a full rankmaniac 2012 day to submit a single article to the 50 submission sites in my list. Admittedly Ive been doing it for a while so rankmaniac 2012 Im fairly fast at it but its not rankmaniac 2012 a difficult task. Once youve done it a couple of times youll have it down to a fine art. You just have to work hard and efficiently rankmaniac 2012 when you do it. Q Who will publish my article A Generally people publish prewritten articles because they want eyes on paper. In other words they want to generate traffic to their site. Helpful articles are one way of doing that because theyre keywordrich and they enhance the publishers search engine ranking. Expert helpful articles also make the publisher seem like a credible authority <a href='/'> on </a> a particular subject. And of course they develop customer loyalty. There are hundreds of thousands maybe even millions of companies publishing online newsletters ezines and article pages. No matter what your industry youre bound to find quite a few who are interested in what you have to say. In fact once a few publishers recognize you as a good source of content they keep coming back looking for more and even email you asking if you can send them directly. Q How will I know when my article has been published A As one of the conditions of publication you can request that the publisher notifies you when they use your article. Of course most dont bother to do this so its a good idea to set up a Google Alert httpwww.google.comalerts which notifies you when your URL has rankmaniac 2012 been published on a web page. Google doesnt pick them all up but it picks up a rankmaniac 2012 lot. Whenever you receive an alert you can visit the page to make sure the article is unchanged and the link back to your site is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles rankmaniac 2012 still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website rankmaniac 2012 A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a new page for every article and link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do <a href='../../../../index/payoff/presentation/difference.html'> my </a> article PR A Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people whod be doing it are... Theyd be doing it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties theyd face are... Here are the key steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where its published. Q How long rankmaniac 2012 will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. <a href='../../../../index/payoff/presentation/difference/robotstxt.html'> Depending </a> on how rankmaniac 2012 much competition youre facing for keywords and where the rankmaniac 2012 links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and <a href='../../../../index/payoff/presentation/difference/publisher.html'> industry </a> directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands rankmaniac 2012 of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most rankmaniac 2012 directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many rankmaniac 2012 directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is rankmaniac 2012 related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. rankmaniac 2012 As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either c

    ery readable article which would rankmaniac 2012 be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont rankmaniac 2012 go rankmaniac 2012 to the effort of publishing your article andor your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few people will see your article rankmaniac 2012 there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter rankmaniac 2012 where its published. rankmaniac 2012 Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. rankmaniac 2012 They contain thousands rankmaniac 2012 of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are rankmaniac 2012 of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated rankmaniac 2012 to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 rankmaniac 2012 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a rankmaniac 2012 listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at rankmaniac 2012 httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well <a href='../../../../index/payoff/faq/reputable.html'> known </a> method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you rankmaniac 2012 possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be rankmaniac 2012 the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the rankmaniac 2012 low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012.jpg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' /> site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of rankmaniac 2012 high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for rankmaniac 2012 link partners one way of assessing rankmaniac 2012 a rankmaniac 2012 sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which rankmaniac 2012 method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance if rankmaniac 2012 you had 100 links to your site yesterday but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full impact until it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links rankmaniac 2012 for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which rankmaniac 2012 generate links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company that you prefer your sites ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Dont get caught out When youre researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it. If they cant or wont tell you DO NOT engage them. If they tell you but you are unable to completely understand DO NOT engage them there are no link generation methods which are too complex for the layperson to understand when explained properly. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly what youre paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Some links are better than <a href='../../../../index/payoff/faq/reputable/pictures.html'> others. </a> Dont use autolinkgeneration software Dont set up websites simply to rankmaniac 2012 host links to your main site rankmaniac 2012 Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo Directories Check where your competitors links are coming from Write and submit articles for Internet publication Submit your site to local and industry directories Look for link partners but dont spend too much time on it Link generation takes a long time no matter rankmaniac 2012 how you do it SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 36 Step 6 Monitor your progress 36 Step 6 Monitor your progress Now that youve done the lions share of the hard work you can sit back and observe the results of your <a href='../../../../index/payoff/faq/reputable/seo.html'> handiwork. </a> Its very important that you monitor your progress. Keep an eye on how many links youre generating where theyre coming from and the overall impact on your ranking. Monitor how many links youre generating Its important to monitor how rankmaniac 2012 many links youre generating because you can crossreference that information against improvements in ranking to estimate how much effort your SEO push is going to take. e.g. If you generate 300 links and your site goes from number 150 to number 15 you know that you should be topping the rankings before too long. If on the other hand rankmaniac 2012 your ranking <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> has only marginally increased you rankmaniac 2012 know you <a href='../../../../index/payoff/faq/reputable/expert.html'> need </a> to work a lot harder.

Q What rankmaniac 2012 should I write about A Write about what you know. Make sure its related to your business so you can use the keywords you want to rank for and helpful so it gets published. For example if youre a manufacturer of industrial plastics you might write an article or series of articles on how best to handle Teflon tubing prior to installation. Once you get thinking about it youll probably find there are hundreds of articles you could write that are helpful. You may even have rankmaniac 2012 some of them partly written already in your instruction manuals or installation guides etc. Another good idea is to <a href='../../../../index/four/fairly/asking.html'> think </a> of all the questions you get asked by customers and potential customers.

You may even cut down phone support time Q How long should my article be A The best articles are only as long as they need to be. Keep it short and sweet theres nothing wrong with a 400 word article. By the same token rankmaniac 2012 if you need 1500 words to say all you need to say thats fine as well but Id still be thinking about how to break that into three parts and get three times as many links. Q How often to submit A Whenever you write an article. Q What kind of writing should I use A Simply write in a style that your audience will be comfortable with. If theyre from the old school dont write like I am. Dont use contractions dont end sentences with prepositions and dont start sentences with and or but. But if theyre not old school just use conversational English. In fact the more of yourself you include in the article the more engaging it will be. The key is to make it readable. Q Should I focus on keywords A Yes Yes Yes Optimize your articles just as you optimize your website. In fact as youll probably post rankmaniac 2012 the articles on your website youre really are writing for your website anyway. If possible turn a few keywords into links back to your site. And always try to include keywords in the headline and byline of your article. And dont worry about being seen as Spam if your article provides good quality information and guidance it wont be seen as rankmaniac 2012 spam by the search engines even when its keywordrich. rankmaniac 2012 Q Do I need to vary the byline A There is some evidence to suggest that the search engines prefer varied link text in links back to your site otherwise they may view the links as artificially generated i.e. SPAM.

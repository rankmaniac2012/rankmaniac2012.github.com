    ite is functioning. Q How much crosspublication of a single article is acceptable A It doesnt matter. I have some articles that have been published on many different websites probably hundreds. These articles still get good coverage on reputable sites with good PR. Q rankmaniac 2012 Will the publisher change my article A No generally not. Changing articles is just extra work. In fact rankmaniac 2012 <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-pond.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech pond.jpeg' /> thats why publishers like good articles and consistent content providers because that means they dont have to do any extra work. Ive had my articles published thousands of times and dont recall a single instance of an article being changed without my permission. If youre worried about it you can include an instruction not to change the article in your conditions of publication. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 32 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 32 Q Should I post my article on my website A Yes Articles are solid keywordrich content. Search engines and visitors alike love them. Add a rankmaniac 2012 new page for every article and <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012.jpg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' /> link to each from a top level articles page see httpwww.divinewrite.comarticles.htm for a working example. Q Can I get an SEO copywriter to do my article PR A Yes. Any SEO copywriter should be able to write keyword rich articles and submit them to a number of high traffic article submission sites. Q What kind of information would I rankmaniac 2012 need to supply an SEO copywriter to write my article A Youd need to tell your SEO copywriter something like We want to write an article which helps people install Teflon tubing. The kinds of people whod be doing it are... Theyd be doing it because... The benefits of our tubing are... The difficulties theyd face are... Here are the key rankmaniac 2012 steps to successful installation... Using this information your SEO copywriter should be able to put together a very readable article which would be bound to get published. Q Will my reputation suffer rankmaniac 2012 if my article appears on a dubious site A It shouldnt. Most dubious sites will either be unrelated or have very low traffic. If the site is unrelated the publisher wont go to the effort of publishing your article andor rankmaniac 2012 your target market wont see it. If its related but has very low traffic very few rankmaniac 2012 people will see rankmaniac 2012 your article there anyway. And besides even if your article appears on a dubious site it probably wont be changed because dubious or not publishers dont create extra work for themselves. So your original presentation content and intent will be unaffected. Write a good article and it always reflects well on you no matter where its published. <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of <a href='/'> pages. </a> And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most are of questionable rankmaniac 2012 value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories rankmaniac 2012 are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing rankmaniac 2012 its only worth paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of <a href='../../../../index/increase/secret/love/bit.html'> links. </a> Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories <a href='../../../../index/increase/secret/love/imposed.html'> take </a> rankmaniac 2012 a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in rankmaniac 2012 a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking rankmaniac 2012 sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-garden.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech garden.jpeg' /> buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner rankmaniac 2012 requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR rankmaniac 2012 sites. Although the rankmaniac 2012 link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. rankmaniac 2012 SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step rankmaniac 2012 5 Generate links back to your site rankmaniac 2012 34 3. Even if you rankmaniac 2012 offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory rankmaniac 2012 to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one rankmaniac 2012 way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you <a href='../../../../index/increase/secret/love/like.html'> visit. </a> How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at rankmaniac 2012 it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is rankmaniac 2012 it possible to generate <img src='../../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi.gif' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi.gif' /> links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For rankmaniac 2012 instance if you had 100 links to your site yesterday but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full impact until it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very rankmaniac 2012 quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment rankmaniac 2012 either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase rankmaniac 2012 in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company that you prefer your sites ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Dont get caught out When youre researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it. If they cant or wont tell you DO NOT engage them. If they tell you but you are unable to completely understand DO NOT engage them there are no link generation methods which are too complex for the layperson to understand when explained properly. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly what youre paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter

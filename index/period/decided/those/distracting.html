SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 8 Step rankmaniac 2012 1 Understand what SEO means 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means Before launching straight into an explanation of SEO lets talk a bit about search engines. A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website doesnt rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines rankmaniac 2012 its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue. And remember being ranked number 1 when you search for your company name or web address doesnt count. You rankmaniac 2012 need to rank highly for the words your customers use at search engines. Search engine rankmaniac 2012 results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more rankmaniac 2012 advertising revenue. In other words their results must be rankmaniac 2012 relevant. Relevant results makes for a good search engine irrelevant results makes for a shortlived search engine. Most search engines these days return two types of results whenever you click Search NaturalOrganic The real search results. The results that most users are looking for and which take up most of the window. For most searches the search engine displays a long list of links to sites with content which is related to the word you searched for. These results are ranked according to how relevant and important they are. Paid Pure advertising. This is how rankmaniac 2012 the search engines make their money.

These ads look similar to rankmaniac 2012 the natural search results but rankmaniac 2012 are normally labeled Sponsored Links and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 When people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads.

How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site rankmaniac 2012 is useful and should be included rankmaniac 2012 in the search engines search results. This is where SEO comes in So what

  <p>
    iscussed on p.28. but most are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and has <a href='../../../../index/think/second/today.html'> a </a> high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate rankmaniac 2012 links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its best if your link appears on a page with few if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. They can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. <a href='/'> Also </a> keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much rankmaniac 2012 time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that accept links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look rankmaniac 2012 for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to <a href='../../../../index/think/second/today/phrases.html'> theirs </a> ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software rankmaniac 2012 which locates high rankmaniac 2012 ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your rankmaniac 2012 search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive rankmaniac 2012 many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most <br /><br /> link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although rankmaniac 2012 the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their rankmaniac 2012 ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site rankmaniac 2012 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested rankmaniac 2012 because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to rankmaniac 2012 obscure the purpose of <br /><br /> their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want to look like a directory to their customers. TIP If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is how Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar rankmaniac 2012 from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time rankmaniac 2012 Its impossible to say how much time rankmaniac 2012 youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to generate links too fast Yes its possible. But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance if you had 100 links to your site yesterday but you have 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full rankmaniac 2012 impact until rankmaniac 2012 it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens rankmaniac 2012 of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links rankmaniac 2012 very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide to outsource the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate links to a domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to rankmaniac 2012 your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company that you rankmaniac 2012 prefer your site's ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Don't get caught out When you're researching SEO companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it. If they can't or won't tell you DO NOT engage them. If they tell you but you are unable to completely understand DO NOT engage them there are no link generation methods which are too complex for the layperson to understand when explained properly. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly rankmaniac 2012 what you're paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a rankmaniac 2012 high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Some links are better than others. Dont use autolinkgeneration software Dont set up websites simply to <a href='../../../../index/think/second/today/robots.html'> host </a> links to your main site Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo <br /><br /> Directories Check where your competitors links are coming from Write and submit articles for Internet publication Submit your site <br /><br /> to local and industry directories Look for link partners but rankmaniac 2012 dont spend too much time on it Link generation takes a long time no matter how you do it SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 36 Step 6 Monitor your progress 36 Step 6 Monitor your progress Now that youve done the lions share of the hard work you can sit back and observe the results of your handiwork.

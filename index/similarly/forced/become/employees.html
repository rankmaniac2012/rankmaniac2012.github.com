    product or service. These ads look similar to the natural search results but are normally labeled Sponsored Links rankmaniac 2012 and normally take up a smaller portion of the window. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 9 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 9 rankmaniac 2012 When rankmaniac 2012 people use search engines to find content they normally pay a lot more attention to the natural results than the paid results because they know these results are more relevant and they know the Sponsored Links are simply ads. When we talk about search engine ranking were talking about ranking well in the natural search results. This ebook does not cover Sponsored Links. How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the natural results. You can only get a high ranking if your content is seen as relevant by the search engines. Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details. Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search results. This is where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are Keywords for relevance Links to your site for importance TIP Think of the search engines as <br /><br /> a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy rankmaniac 2012 of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches for those words. For more information on choosing keywords see Step 3 Choose your keywords on p.14. on using keywords on your site see Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines on p.17. Links to your site Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site rankmaniac 2012 is. They assume that if its important enough for a lot of other sites to link to its important enough for them to display at the top of the rankings. Links to your site backlinks or inbound links are the single most important factor in rankmaniac 2012 ranking. The more links you have to your site from rankmaniac 2012 other sites the better your ranking. For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your <a href='../../../../index/similarly/forced/become/successful.html'> site </a> on p.27. Chapter Summary If you have a lot of the right keywords used in real sentences distributed realistically throughout your site and a lot of links from other relevant sites you stand a good chance of being ranked highly. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything <a href='../../../../index/similarly/forced/become.html'> right </a> it takes months before your site is even indexed and more months before it starts to rank well. As a rule of thumb never expect to rank highly within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a rankmaniac 2012 period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does this rankmaniac 2012 to discourage the creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking of some rankmaniac 2012 other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google will probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential <br /><br /> customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply rankmaniac 2012 go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html enter your URL domain name and a few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it. You only have to do it once and only for your <a href='../../../../index/similarly/forced/become/ids.html'> top </a> level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 12 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned rankmaniac 2012 above it takes quite a while for your site rankmaniac 2012 to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 search rankmaniac 2012 engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rankmaniac 2012 rest. Whats more at the time of writing most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The only ones that do are Google described above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html offers free submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submission Netscape covered by Google submission Fast rankmaniac 2012 All the Web covered by Yahoo submission Ask Jeeves Teoma at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Hotbot at <br /><br /> date of writing was not accepting new submissions Lycos at date of writing was not accepting new submissions AOL at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Looksmart at date of writing was not accepting new submissions TIP My website httpwww.divinewrite.com reached no.1 worldwide on Google.com for my primary keyword copywriter without a dollar being spent on search engine submission. I only ever submitted my site to the engines that offer free <br /><br /> submission. Do I need <a href='/'> to </a> submit my site to other search engines As a rule no. With an estimated 8.8 billion pages indexed approximately 76 of rankmaniac 2012 the Internet Google is number 1 when it comes to search engines. Its argued that once Google has indexed your SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 13 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 13 site the other search engines will follow. rankmaniac 2012 Theoretically you dont actually need to submit your site to Google either because its always on the lookout for rankmaniac 2012 new content and will eventually find your rankmaniac 2012 site of its own accord. Google actually states Given the large number of sites submitting URLs it's likely your pages will be found in an automatic crawl before they make rankmaniac 2012 it into our index through the URL submission form. Google Information for Webmasters httpwww.google.com.auwebmasters1.htmlA1 Personally I wouldnt like to take the risk. Having said that it certainly doesnt hurt to submit your site to other search engines especially if you havent developed any content for it yet. Chapter Summary Submit your rankmaniac 2012 domain name to Google as rankmaniac 2012 soon as you register rankmaniac 2012 it even if you havent built your site yet or done anything else. rankmaniac 2012 Although you dont actually need to submit your site to <a href='../../../../index/similarly/forced/become/readability.html'> the </a> rankmaniac 2012 other search engines you may as well submit it to Yahoo and MSN as they offer free and simple submissions. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is decide which words you rankmaniac 2012 want to rank well for. This is rankmaniac 2012 called performing a keyword analysis. Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the benefits you offer your customers. There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two examples are Overtures inventory tool which you can find at httpinventory.overture.comdsearchinventorysuggestion. This tool is free and very easy to use and understand but it only tells you how many searches <a href='../../../../index/similarly/forced/become/agegroup.html'> have </a> been conducted in the previous month for your keyword and similar keywords. WordTracker which you can find at httpwww.wordtracker.com. WordTracker is a much more powerful tool but you have

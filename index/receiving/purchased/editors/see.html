SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 8 Step 1 Understand what SEO means Before launching straight into an explanation of SEO lets talk a bit about search engines. A little about search engines Approximately 7580 of website traffic comes through search engines. Whats more research shows that most people dont look beyond the first 2 pages of search results. This means if your website <a href='/'> doesnt </a> rank in the first 2 pages of the major search engines its only receiving 2030 of its rightful traffic and revenue.

Search engine results The biggest concern for search engine companies like Google and Yahoo is finding content that will bring them more traffic and thus more advertising revenue.

How search engines decide what appears in the natural search results IMPORTANT You cannot pay a search engine in return for a high ranking in the rankmaniac 2012 natural results.

Search engines identify relevant content for their search results by sending out spiders or rankmaniac 2012 robots which crawl analyze your site and index record its details.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or rankmaniac 2012 thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything right it takes months before your site is even indexed and more months before it starts to rank well.

If you wait until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential rankmaniac 2012 customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html enter your URL rankmaniac 2012 domain name and a few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then click Submit. Thats all there is to it.

Complex algorithms are then employed to determine whether your site is useful and should be included in the search engines search rankmaniac 2012 results. This is where SEO comes in So what is SEO SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is <a href='../../../index/increase/change.html'> the </a> art of making your website relevant and important to the search engines in order to rank highly in their results. The two main weapons in your arsenal are Keywords for relevance rankmaniac 2012 Links to your site for importance TIP rankmaniac 2012 Think of the search engines as a big election. All the websites in the world are candidates. The copy on your website is your campaign. The links to your rankmaniac 2012 website are votes. The more votes links a candidate website has the more important it is and the higher its ranking. Keywords Search engines send out robots or spiders to analyze your website. They look at the words youve used to figure out what you do. This tells them when to display your site in their search results. Keywords are the first thing you need to think about when you start your SEO journey. Figure out what words your customers are looking for at search engines. These words are known as keywords. The rankmaniac 2012 idea is to frequently use these keywords in the copy of your website SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 10 Step 1 Understand what SEO means 10 and in the HTML code behind the rankmaniac 2012 page. As a rule of thumb the more frequently you use these keywords the more relevant youll be considered by the search engines and the more likely you are to appear in searches rankmaniac 2012 for those words. For more information on choosing keywords see Step 3 Choose your keywords on p.14. on using keywords on your site see Step 4 Optimize Your Website for Search Engines on p.17. Links to your site Links to your site tell the search engines how important your site is. They assume that if its important enough for a lot of other sites to link to its important enough for them <a href='../../../index/increase/change/step/spending.html'> to </a> display at the top of the rankings. Links to your site backlinks or inbound links are the single <a href='../../../index/increase/change/anything.html'> most </a> important factor in ranking. The more links you have to your site from other sites the better your ranking. For more information on generating backlinks see Step 5 Generate links back to your site on p.27.

SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine rankmaniac 2012 Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 11 Step 2 Submit your site to Google As soon as you register your domain name submit it to Google Even if you havent built your site or thought about your content submit your domain name to Google. In fact even if you havent fully articulated your business plan and marketing plan submit your domain name to Google. Dont wait There are two reasons for this. Firstly getting on the search engines has always taken a long time for a new site. Even assuming you do everything rankmaniac 2012 right it takes months before your site is even indexed and more months before it starts to rank well. As a rule <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-bi-wilson.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech bi wilson.jpeg' /> of thumb never expect to rank highly rankmaniac 2012 within 6 months of submitting your site to Google. The second reason is a recent phenomenon called Google Sandbox. Many SEO experts believe that Google sandboxes new websites. Whenever it detects a new website it withholds its rightful ranking for a period while it determines whether your site is a genuine credible long term site. It does this to discourage <a href='../../../index/increase/change/readability.html'> the </a> creation of SPAM websites sites which serve no useful purpose other than to boost the ranking rankmaniac 2012 of some other site. By submitting your domain name to Google as soon as you register it youre establishing a site history even if the site has no content. By the time youve built your site and developed your content and written your business and marketing plans Google <a href='/'> will </a> probably see no need to sandbox you. If you wait rankmaniac 2012 until launch day to submit your site youll spend a month or two maybe more sitting in the sandbox watching potential customers spend their money elsewhere. How to submit your site to Google Dont waste money by paying rankmaniac 2012 someone else to submit your site to Google. Its easy Simply go to httpwww.google.com.auaddurl.html enter your URL domain name and a few comments or keywords to describe your site. Then <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-demotivational.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 demotivational.jpeg' /> click Submit. Thats all there is to it. You only rankmaniac 2012 have to do it once and only for your top level page i.e. Home page. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 12 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 12 Googles robots will then crawl your website the next time theyre out and about. Of course they dont guarantee that youll be included in their results. IMPORTANT As mentioned above it takes quite a while for your site to appear in the search engines. This is partly because the search engines are big and slow especially when it comes to new sites. It will take a minimum of 68 weeks before your site is indexed. How to submit your site to other search engines There are hundreds of search engines on the Internet. Its a lucrative business after all But dont panic studies suggest that the top 11 search engines account for about 90 of web traffic. In other words if you have the top 11 covered theres no need to submit to the rest. Whats more at the time of writing most of the top 11 dont actually accept submissions. The only ones that do are Google described above Yahoo and MSN. Heres a list of the available submit pages. Yahoo httpsearch.yahoo.cominfosubmit.html offers free <a href='../../../index/increase/change/step/keywordrich.html'> rankmaniac 2012 </a> submission MSN httpsearch.msn.comdocssubmit.aspxFORMWSDD2 offers free submission Alta Vista covered by Yahoo submission Netscape covered by rankmaniac 2012 Google submission Fast All the Web covered by Yahoo submission Ask Jeeves Teoma at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Hotbot at date of writing was not accepting new submissions Lycos at date of writing was not accepting new submissions AOL at date of writing rankmaniac 2012 was not accepting new rankmaniac 2012 submissions Looksmart at date of writing was not accepting new submissions TIP My website httpwww.divinewrite.com reached no.1 rankmaniac 2012 worldwide on Google.com for my primary keyword copywriter without a dollar being spent on search engine submission. I only ever submitted my site to the engines that offer free submission. Do I need to submit my site to other search engines As a rule no. With an estimated 8.8 billion pages indexed approximately 76 rankmaniac 2012 of the Internet Google is number 1 when it comes to search engines. Its argued that once Google has indexed your SEO Secrets rankmaniac 2012 V1.3 Copyright rankmaniac 2012 Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 13 Step 2 Submit your site to Google 13 site <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012.jpg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012.jpg' /> the other search engines will follow. Theoretically you dont actually need to submit rankmaniac 2012 your site to Google either because its always on the lookout for new content and will eventually find your site of its own accord. Google actually rankmaniac 2012 states Given the large number of sites submitting URLs its likely your pages will be found in an automatic crawl before they make it into our index through the URL submission form. Google Information for Webmasters httpwww.google.com.auwebmasters1.htmlA1 Personally I wouldnt like to take the risk. Having said that it certainly doesnt hurt to submit your site to other search engines especially if you havent developed any content for it yet. Chapter Summary Submit your domain name to Google as soon as you register it even if you havent built your site yet or done anything else. Although you dont actually need to submit your site to <a href='../../../index/increase/change/step/spam.html'> the </a> other search engines you may as well submit it to Yahoo <a href='../../../index/increase/change/step/measured.html'> and </a> MSN as they offer free and simple submissions. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords 14 Step 3 Choose your keywords The first thing you need to do when you begin chasing a good search engine ranking is decide which words you want to rank well for. This is called performing a keyword analysis. Keyword analysis involves a bit of research and a good knowledge of your business and the benefits you offer your customers. There are several websites specifically designed to make keyword analysis easier. Two examples are Overtures inventory tool which you can find <img src='../../../images/rankmaniac-2012-tech-other.jpeg' title='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' alt='rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 tech other.jpeg' /> at httpinventory.ove

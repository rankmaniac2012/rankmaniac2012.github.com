  <h1>rankmaniac 2012 index think second overall</h1>
  <p>
    reflects well on you no matter where it's published. Q How long will it take for my ranking to increase A There are no guarantees in SEO. It all takes time. For a start the search engines can take up to 2 months to update their index of pages. And a single inbound link generally wont have much impact. Depending on how much competition youre facing for keywords and where the links are coming from 100 inbound links may not make much of a difference. Links from high PageRank sites are more rankmaniac 2012 beneficial to your ranking. So dont expect anything to happen too quickly. But if youre dedicated and youre prepared to write and submit quite a few articles youll definitely see results within a few months. Submit your site to local and industry directories Another marginally useful method <br /><br /> of generating links is to submit your site to online local directories and industry directories. There are many websites which function purely as directories. They contain thousands of links to other sites. Some of these are very good such as DMOZ and Yahoo discussed on p.28. but most rankmaniac 2012 are of questionable value. There are several reasons for this 1. Most directories are unrelated to the subject material of your website and remember ideal rankmaniac 2012 links come from related websites. 2. Many directories will charge you rankmaniac 2012 for a listing its only worth paying if the website is related and has a high PR. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 33 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 33 3. Most directories contain thousands of links. Every page can have hundreds of links to other sites. As mentioned above its rankmaniac 2012 best if your link appears on a page with few rankmaniac 2012 if any links to other pages. 4. Most directories are not very good. Directories are rankmaniac 2012 about money they either charge you to add a listing or they sell advertising space or both. rankmaniac 2012 <a href='/'> They </a> can be a great income source for their owners and this makes them a very inviting business idea. As a result thousands of new directories are popping up every year and very few of them are any good. Keep your eye out for directories that are relevant andor have a high ranking or PR. Also keep your eye out for directories which might bring you useful traffic e.g. local business directories. But dont spend too much time doing it. Your time would be far better spent writing and submitting articles. TIP If you really feel the need to add your site to directories take a look at httpwww.webproworld.comviewtopic.phpt21900sidaea99f48670ee336f2b922 c79983e394 for a very comprehensive and regularly updated list of directories that <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/designed.html'> accept </a> links. Look for link partners Probably the most well known method of generating links is to look for link partners. This is done in a variety of ways ask customers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs ask suppliers to link to your site possibly in return for a link to theirs look for relevant high ranking sites and ask them to link to you possibly in return for a link to theirs buy SEO software which locates high ranking sites and automatically emails their owners asking them to link rankmaniac 2012 to you possibly in return for a link to theirs Interestingly looking for link partners tends to be the least effective method of increasing your search engine ranking because 1. Its normally done via email and unfortunately webmasters of high ranking sites receive many link partner requests each day not to mention hundreds of other SPAM emails. Theyre normally automated and irrelevant. As a result most email initiated link partner requests are deleted. 2. Most link partner requests are sent by webmasters of low PR sites to webmasters of high PR sites. Although the link would be very beneficial to the low PR site it wouldnt help the high PR site at all and may in fact hinder their ranking. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 34 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 34 3. Even if you offer a reciprocal link a link back to their website most webmasters of high PR sites will not be interested because its extra work. Whats more they wont want to obscure <br /><br /> the purpose of their site with hundreds of links relevant or not they dont want rankmaniac 2012 to look like a directory to their customers. <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/unfortunately.html'> TIP </a> If you decide to manually look for link partners one way of assessing a sites importance is to look at their Google PageRank PR. PR is <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/blacklisted.html'> how </a> Google scores importance. It gives all sites a mark out of 10. Any site with a PR of 4 or above is generally considered a worthy link partner. By downloading the Google Toolbar from httptoolbar.google.com you can view the PR of any site you visit. How long will it take A long time Its impossible to say how much rankmaniac 2012 time youll need to spend generating links but you can be sure itll be a while no matter which method of link generation you use. You just have to keep at it until you have achieved a high ranking. Even then youll still need to dedicate some ongoing rankmaniac 2012 time to the task otherwise your ranking will drop. Is it possible to rankmaniac 2012 generate links too fast Yes its possible. rankmaniac 2012 rankmaniac 2012 But using the methods outlined above its extremely unlikely. The search engines dont like to see links generated too fast. For instance if you <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/visible.html'> had </a> 100 links to your site yesterday but you <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/layperson.html'> have </a> 2100 today the search engines will assume youve done something a little shady and sandbox your links i.e. delay their full impact until it establishes their validity. You may even be penalized more harshly than this. Thats why its not a good idea to set up multiple independent websites all containing dozens of links back to your main site. This would get you lots of links very quickly but it might also see you blacklisted Paying an SEO company to generate links for you Generating links takes a long time and involves a lot of work. Like any other form of promotion it requires investment either in time or money. If you decide to outsource rankmaniac 2012 the task of generating links be careful. There are some companies which generate rankmaniac 2012 links to a rankmaniac 2012 domain of their own and pass the value of these links on to your site. This does NOT result in a permanent increase in the ranking of your site. These companies charge a monthly fee and so long as you pay the fee your site may rank highly. But as soon as you stop paying their fee e.g. you find another SEO company rankmaniac 2012 that you prefer your site's ranking will drop back to where it was when you started out. Effectively they hold you rankmaniac 2012 to ransom. SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 35 Step 5 Generate links back to your site 35 Don't get rankmaniac 2012 caught out When you're researching <a href='../../../index/think/second/today.html'> SEO </a> companies to generate links for you ALWAYS ask them how they will do it. If they can't or won't tell you DO NOT engage them. If they tell you but you are unable to completely understand DO NOT engage them there are no link generation methods which are too complex for the layperson <a href='../../../index/think/second/determined.html'> to </a> understand when explained properly. Also always be clear in your own mind on exactly what you're paying for. Remember that there are two parts to obtaining a high ranking optimizing your site and generating links back to your site. Always get your SEO company to explain exactly which parts they will do for you and how they plan to do it. Chapter Summary Generally speaking the more links you have back to your site the higher your ranking will be. Some links are better than others. Dont rankmaniac 2012 use autolinkgeneration software Dont set up websites simply to host links to your main site Add your site to DMOZ Yahoo <br /><br /> Directories Check where your competitors links are coming from Write <a href='../../../index/think/second/overall/clickable.html'> and </a> submit articles for Internet publication Submit your site to local and industry directories Look for link partners but dont spend too much time on it Link generation takes a long time no matter how you do it SEO Secrets V1.3 Copyright Divine Write Copywriting Pty Ltd 36 Step 6 Monitor your progress <a href='../../../index/think/second/beyond.html'> 36 </a> Step 6 Monitor your progress Now that youve done rankmaniac 2012 the lions rankmaniac 2012 share of the hard work you can sit back and observe the results of your rankmaniac 2012 handiwork.
